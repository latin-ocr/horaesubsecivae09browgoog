Notes on Art. 397

It has long been a question in the ethics of hc-
tion, whether sympathy with ideal sorrows be bene-
ficial or mischievous. That it is pleasurable we all
know. And a distinction has been made between
pity as an emotion ending with its own gratification,
and pity as a motive, a moving power, passing, by
anecessity of its nature, into action and practical
performance.

But, without going into the subject, we may give,
as a good practical rule, let your moral sense be so
clear and healthy as to discern at once the genuine
ἠ objects of pity3 and then, let them be fictitious or
real, you may pity them safely with all your might.
In either case you will get good, and the good will
not end with yourself, even in the first case.

The story of Joseph, for instance, is to us fictiti-
ous, or rather, it is ideal, and in weeping over him,
or over his beart-broken father, we know we can
do them no good, or give them no sympathy3 but
where will you fvnd a merely human story more
salutary, more delightful, more appropriate, to
every one of our intellectual, moral, and, let us
add, our imaginative and aesthetical faculties?
