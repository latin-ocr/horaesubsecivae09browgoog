48 Horae Subsecivae.

Stewart Rose's vers de socic‘te‘, but have more of the
graphic force and deep feeling and fine humour of
Crabbe and Cowper in their substance, with a

Church spires, tower, docls, streets, terrsces, and trees,
Bacl'd by green fields, which mount by due degrees
Into brown uplands‚ stretching high away

To where, by silent tarns, the wild deer stray.
Below, with gentle tide, the Atlantic Sea

Laves the curved beach, 3ηά fills the cheerful qua'y,
Where frequent glides the sail, 3ηά dips the oar,
And smolring steamer halts with hissing roar.''

Then follows a long passage of great eloquence,

truth, and wit, directed against the feverish, af·

Surrounded by blue women and pale men,”
