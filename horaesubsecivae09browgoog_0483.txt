“ Oh, I’m Wat, Wat.” 461

But when thou leav'st me,
Doubts and fears arise,
And darkness teigne,
Where all before was light.
The sunshine of my toul
Is in those eyes,'
And when they leave me
All the world is night.

But when thou art near me,
Sorrow seems to fly,

And then I feel, aa well I may,

That on this earth there dwells not one
So blest ae Ι.”ι

Then taking down Chambers's Scottislr Songs, he
read aloud :-

“ 0, I'm wat, wat,
0, I'm wat and weary;
Yet fain wad Ι rise and rin,
ΙΙΙ thocht Ι would meet my dearie.
Aye waulin'‚ O!
Waultin’ aye, and weary3
Sleep I can get nane
For thinkin' o’ my dearie.

Simmer ’s a pleasant time,
Flowers o' every colour;
The water rins ower tlte heugh,
And Ι long for my true lover.
