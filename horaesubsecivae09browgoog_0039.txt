Vaughan’s Poems, &a 17

Benumme the year, blithe as of old let us

Mid' noise and war, of peace and mirth discusse.
This portion thou wert born for. Why should we
Vex at the time's ridicuious miserie?

An age that thus hath fooled itself, and will,

Spite of thy teeth and mine, persist so still.

Let 's sit then at this fire3 and, while wce steal

A revell in the Τ own, let others scal,

Purchase, and cheat, and who can let them pay,
Till those black deeds bring on the darksome day.
Innocent spenders wee! a better use

Shail wear out our short lease, and leave the obtuse
Rout to their husks. They and their bags at best
Have cares in earnest. Wee care for a jest! '’

When about thirty years of age, he had a long and

serious iilness, during which his mind underwent

y an entire and final change on the most important
of all subjects3 and thenceforward he seems to
have lived “ soberly‚ righteously, and godly.’'

In his Preface to the “ Silrx Scinrtillans‚’' hc says,
“The God of the spirits of all flesh harh granted
me a further use of mine than Ι did look for in the
body; and when Ι expected and had prepared for
amessage of death, then did he answer me with
life3 Ι hope to his glory and my great advantage3
that Ι may floorish not with leafe oniy, but with
some fruit also.’' And he speaks of himself as
one of the converts of “that blessed man, Mr.
George Herbert.'’
