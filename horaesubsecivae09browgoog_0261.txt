Letter to John Cairm, D.D. 239

member well his getting those fat, shapeless, spongy
η German books, as if one would sink in them, and
‚ be bogged in their bibulous, unsized paper3 and
, watching him as he impatiently cut them up, and
Ἴ dived into them in his rapid, eclectic way, tasting

’ them, and dropping for my play such a lot of sofr,
large, curled bits from the paper-cutter, leaving the
edges all shaggy. He never came to bed when Ι
was awake, which was not to be wondered at; but
I can remember often awaking far on in the night
or morning, and seeing that keen, beautiful, intense,
face bending over these Rosenmiillers, and Ernes-
tis, and Storrs, and Kuinoels-the fite out, and the

grey dawn peering through the window; and when ’ ·

he heard me move, he would speak to me in the
foolish words of endeatment my mother was wont
to use, and come to bed, and take me, warm as l
was, into his cold bosom.

Vitringa in Jesaiam I especially remember, a
noble folio. Even then, with that eagerness to
communicate what he had himself found, of which
you must often have been made the subject, he
went and told it. He would try to make me,
small man as I waS, “ apprehend'' what he and
Vitringa between them had made out of the fifty-

many years my mother’s parasol‚ by his orders—I dare-
say, for long, the only one in Biggar.
