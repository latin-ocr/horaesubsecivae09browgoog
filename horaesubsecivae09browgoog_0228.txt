correct and homely. There is a good deal of the
stiffness of the old school about the doctor3 he
speaks as if in knee-breeches and buckles, with a
powdered wig, and an interminable silk waistcoat,
agold·headed cane at his side, and his cocked hat
under his arm. To us, however, this is a great
charm of the book, and of such books, There
may be stiffness and some Johnsonian swell about
them3 some words bigger than the thoughts, like
a boy in his father's coat 3 some sentences in
which the meaning ends before its voice, and the
rummel resounds after having parted company with
the gumption ,· but with all this, there is a tem· ³
perance, and soundness, and dignity of view-a, κ
good breeding, and good feeling, and a reticence
and composure, which, in this vapouring, turbulent,
unmannerly age of oure, is a refreshing pleasure,
though too often one of memory.

We are truly glad to see, from a modest note by
Dr. Greenhill, the editor, that he is engaged ona
work on medical morah. He will do it well and
wisely, we have no doubt. The ¹profession is
deeply indebted to him for his edition of Sydenham
—the best monument the Society called by' his name
could raise to that great man, and also for his Life
of Hippocrates, in Smith's Dictionary, and other con·

tributions to medical philosophy¹ and biography.
