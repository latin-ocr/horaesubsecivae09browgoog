Mystifications. 347

life-long friend, Mrs. Gillies, widow of Lord Gillies,
she thus tells her story :-

Domum, April 1859.

M Υ DEARES T MRS. GILLIES,

To you and the friends who have par-
taken in these “ Mystifications,” l dedicate this little
volume, trusting that, aster a silence offorty years, its
echoes may awahen many agreeable memorials ofa
society that has nearly passed away.

I have heen asked if l had no remorse in ridiculing
singularities of character, or practising deceptions ,·-
certainly not.

There was no personal ridicule or mimirey of any
living creature, but merely the personation or type of a
bygone class, that had survived the fashion of its day.

It was altogether a fanciful existence, developing
itself according to circumstances, or for the amusement
of a select party, among whom the announcement of a
strangcr lady, an original, led to no suspicion of decep-
tion. No one ever tooh offences indeed it generally
elicitcd the finest individual traits os sympathy in the,
minds of the dupes, especially in the case of Mr. Jef-
frey, whose sweet-tempered hindly nature manifested
itself throughout the whole of the tiresome interview
with the law-leving Lady Pitlyal.

No one enjoyed her ecccntricities more than he did,
