DICK

Still liveS, and long may he live l As he was never
born, possibly he may never die 3 be it so, he will
miss us when we are gone. Ι could say much of
him, but agree with the lively and admirable Dr.
Jortin, when, in his dedication of his Remarks on
Ecclesiastical History to the then (17 52) Archbishop
of Canterbury, he excuses himself for not following
the modern custom of praising his Patron, by re·
minding his Grace “that it was a custom amongst
the ancients, not to sacrifice to heroes till after sunset.’'
Ι defer my sacrifice till Dick's sun is set.

’ Ι think every family should have a dog: it is
like having a perpetual baby ; it is the plaything
and crony of the whole house. 'It keeps them all
young. All unite upon Dick. And then be tells

no taleS, betrays no secrets, never sulks‚ asks no

troublesome questions, never gets into debt, never
coming down late for breakfast, or coming in by
his Chubb too early to bed-is always ready for abit
of fun, lies in wait for it, and you may, if choleric,
to your relies, kick him instead of some one else,
who would not take it so meekly, and, moreover,
would certainly not, as he does, ask your pardon
for being kicked.

Never put a collar on your dog-it only gets him
