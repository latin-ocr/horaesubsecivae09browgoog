Vaughan's Poems, &a 2 3

And no new business breaks their pence3
The birds nor sow nor neap, yet sup and dine,
The flowres without clothes live,
Yet Solomon was never drest so fine.

‘⁸ Man hnth still either toyes or Caret

He hath no root, nor to one place is ty'd,
But ever restless and Irregular
About this Earth doth run and ride.
He knows he hoth a home, but scarce knows where3
He says it is so far,
That he nath quite forgot how to go there.

“ He knocks at all doors, strays and roams:
Nay hath not so much wit as some stoneo have,

Which in the darhest nights point to their homes
By some hid sense their Maker gavee
Man is the shuttle, to whose winding quest
And passage through these loome
God order’d motion, but ordain’d no πεῖθ’

There is great moral force about this3 its mea*
sure and words put one in mind of the majestic

lines of Shirley, beginning

“The glories of our earthly state
Are shadows, not substantio things.”

Cocx-enowmo.

‘⁸ Father of lights! what Sunnie seed,
What glance of day hant thou confin'd

Into this bird? To all the breed
This busie Ray thou host assign'd3
