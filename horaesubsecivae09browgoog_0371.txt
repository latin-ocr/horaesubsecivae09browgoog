MRS. RAMSAY SPELDIN.

Another evening Miss Guthrie requested me to
introduce my old lady to Captain Alexander Lind-
say, a son of the late Laird of Kinblethmont‚ and
brother to the present Mr. Lindsay Carnegie, and
Mr. Sandford‚ the late Sir Daniel Sandford.

She carne as a Mrs. Ramsay Speldin‚ an old
sweetheart of the laird's, and was welcomed by
MrS. Guthrie as a friend of the family. The
young people hailed her as a perfectly delightful
old lady, and an original of the pure Scottish char·
acter, and to the laird she was endeared by a thou·
sand pleasing recollections.

He placed her beside himself on the sofa, and
they talked of the days gone by—before the green ¹
parks of Craigie were redeemed from the muir of
Gotterston, and ere there was a tree planted be-
tween the auld house of Craigie and the Castle of
Claypotts.

She spoke of the “gude auld times, when the
laird of F intry widna gie his youngest dochter to
Abercairney, but tell’d him to tak them as God had
gien them to him, or want.”

“ And do you mind‚'' she continued, “the grand

ploys we had at the Middleton; and hoo Mrs.
