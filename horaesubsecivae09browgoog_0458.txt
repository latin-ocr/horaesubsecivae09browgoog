436 Horae Subsecivae.

This picture was conceived by Delaroche last
year, on the spot where the scene is laid, and
painted very soon after. He was at Nice for his
health, and had for his guide upthe St. Bernard,
the son of the man leading the mule, who told
him many things about Napoleon, and how he
looked. As regards colour, it is the best of Dela-
roche's pictures we have seen, it is acurious study
to mark how little, and how much, the young,
thin, spiritual face differs from that of last year’s
picture.

There is something to our minds, not unseason-
able in directing our thoughts to such a spectacle of
mere human greatness, at this (Christmas) sacred
time. So much mischief, crime, and misery, and
yet so much power, intelligence, progress, anda
certain dreadful usefulness in the career of such a
man. What a contrast to His life, who entered our
world 1850 years ago, and whose birth was heralded
by the angel-song, “ Glory to God in the highest,
and on earth peace, goodwill toward men ;'’ whose
religion and example, and continual living influence,
has kept this strange world of ours from being ten·
fold more wicked and miserable than itis. We
would conclude with -the words ,of the poet of ,
¹ In Memoriam-—
