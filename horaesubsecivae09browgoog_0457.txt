⁶ Notas on Art. 435

passed nearly 3000 years before, and as they will
do thousands of years hence. ,They bear down

upon the eye ina formidable way, as if frowning at

the intruder on their snows and silence, and as if
crowding down to withstand his steps. Under is
the spotless snow, with some bits of ice, troubling
the hoofs of the mule. This completes the picture,

¹ which, as we have already said, is homely and

simple in its body, in all that first meets the eye,
though informed throughout with the finest phan-
tasy when the mind rests upon it and reaches its soul.
Every one must be struck with the personal
beauty of Napoleon as represented here. He was
in his 31st year3 had been four years married to
Josephine—the happiest years of his· life3 he had
just come from Egypt, having been hunted across Ι
the Mediterranean by Nelson. His peasaut guide,
. who succeeded to the old man, and who brought
him within sight of Italy, described him as “a very
dark man, and with an eye which, though affable,
he did not like to encounter.’' We can believe
him3 a single look of that eye, or a word from that
mouth, cheered and set in motion the wearied army
as they toiled up “the Valley of Desolation ;'' and
if they stuck fast in despair, the Consul had the

drums beat, and trumpets sounded, as for the charge.
This never failed. He knew his men.
