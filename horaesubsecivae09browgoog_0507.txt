' own labour for that which satisfies no one; indus-
ἱ triously making sawdust into the shapes of bread,

and chaff into the appearance of meal, and con-

contains so much water, and there you have the
amount of water in a bottle; so much albumen,
and there is the albumen3 so much phosphate of
lime, fat, haematin‚ fibrine, salt, etc. etc. Then in
