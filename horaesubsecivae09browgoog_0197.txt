Qeen Mary's Child-Garden. 175

“The woodbine and the light wild rose
Float o'er the broken wall;
And here the mournful nightshade blows,
To note the garden’s fall.

“ Where once a princess wept her woes,
The bird of night complains3
And sighing trees the tale disclose

They leam& from Mary's strains.
“ A. H.'’
