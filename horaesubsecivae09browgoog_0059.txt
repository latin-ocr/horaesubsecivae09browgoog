Vauglzan’s Poems, &a 37

“ Faint from the entrance carne a daylight ray,
And distant sound of living men and things3
This, in th' encountering darkness pass’d away,
That‚ took the tone in which a mourner sings.

‘¹ 1 lit a torch at a sepulchral lamp,
Which shot a thread os light amid the gloom;
And feebly burning ’gainst the rolling damp,
Ι bore it through the regions of the tomb.

‘⁸ Around me stretch’d the slumbers of the dead,
Wbereos the silence acbed upon my ear ,·
More and more noiseless did Ι make my tread,
And yet its echoes chill'd my heart with fear.

“The former men of every age and place,
From all their wand’rings gather’d, round me iay3

The dust of wither’d Empires did 1 trace,
And stood 'mid Generations pass'd away.

“ Ι saw whole cities, that in flood or fite,
Or famine or the plague, gave up their breath;
Whole armies whom a day beheld expire,
Swept by ten thousands to the arms of Death„

“ Ι saw the old world’s white and ware-swept bones,
A giant heap of creatores that had been;
Far and confused the broken skeletons
Lay strewn beyond mine eye's remotest ken.

‘⁸ Death's various shrines-the Urn‚the Stone, the Lamp -
Were scatter'd round, confused, amid the dead 3
Symbols and Types were mould’ring in the damp,
Their shapes were waning and their meaning fled.
