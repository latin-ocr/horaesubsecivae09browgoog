third chapter of his favourite prophet, the princely
Isaiah.1 Even then, so faras I can recal, he never
took notes of what he read. He did not need this,

John Howe was a fine and high art, or rather gift. Heu·

of the Living Temple, “ bearing on its front this doleful
inscription, ‘Here God once dwelt,'’' was like listening
to the recitative of Handel. But Isaiah was his master-

reading at family worship, “His name shall be called

words, “the mighty God,’' similar to the rendering now ’
given to Handel’s music, and doubtless so meant by him3
and then closing with “ the Prince of Peace,'' soft and low.
No man who wishes to feel Isaiah, as well as understand
him, should be ignorant of Handel’s “Messiah.'’ His
prelude to “ Comfort ye''-its simple theme, cheerful and
infinite as the ripple of the unsearchable sea—gives a deeper
meaning to the words. One of my father’s great delights
in his dying months was reading the lives of Handel and
Michael Angelo, then newly out. He felt that the author
of “He was despised,'’ and “He shall feed his floclr,''
and those other wonderful airs, was a man of profound re·
ligious feeling, of which they were the utteranee; and he
rejoiced over the warlilre aits and choruses of·“Judas Mac-
cabaeus.'' You have recorded his estimare of the religious
nature of him of the terribile via ,· he said it was a relief ,

to his mind to lmow that such a mighty genius walked
humbly with his God.
