Dr. Chalmers. 7 ς

among grown-up men, of this straightness of the
ζ soul—of this losing or never finding “cernaii’'
ἶ There is more than is perhaps generally thought in
Ῑ this. Man in a state of perfectiori, would no

sooner think of asking himself-am I right? am I
appearing to be what inwardly I am ἒ than the eye
asks itself-do I see? or achild says t0 itself-dol
love my mother? We have lost this instinctive
sense 3 we have set one portion of ourselvesv aside
to warch the rest; we must keep up appearances
and our consistency ; we must respect-that is,
Ἴ look back upon-ourselveS, and be respected‚ if
ν possible3 we must, by hook pr by cr00k‚ be re·
spectable.

Dr. Chalmers would have been a sorry Ba-
laam 3 he was made of different stuff and for other
purposes. Your “respectable '' men are ever
doing their best to keep their status, to maintain
their position. He never troubled himself about
his status; indeed, we would say status was not the
word for him. He had a sedes on which he sat,
and from which he spoke3 he had an imperium, to
and fro which he roamed as he listed: but astatus
was as little in his way as in that of a Mauritanian
lion. Your merely “sincere'' men are always
thinking of what they said yesterday‚ and what
they may say to·morrow, at the very moment
