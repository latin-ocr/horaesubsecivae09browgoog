Happy Guessing. 183

My object in what I have now written andam
going to write, is to inrpress upon medical students
the value of power and promptitude in combination,
for their professional purposes3 the uses to them of
nearness of the Νοῦς, and of happy guessing ; and
how you may see the sense, and neatnesa, and pith

λόγου), he does not mean to imply that it grows up alro-
gether independenter reason, any more than Whewell
means to say that all the discoveries in the inductive
sciences have been made by men taking ‘shots’ at thern,
as boys at school do at hard passages in their Latin lessons.
On the contrary, no faculty is so absolutely the child of
reason as this faculty of happy guessing. It only attains
to perfectiori after the reason has been long and painfully
trained in the sphere in which the guesses are to be made.
What Aristorle does mean is, that when it has attained
perfection, we are not conscious of the share which reason
has in its operation-it is so rapid that by no analysis can
we detect the presence of reason in irs action. Sit Isaac
Newton seeing the apple fall, and thence ‘guessing’ at the
law of gravitation, is a good instance of εὐστοχία.

“Ἀ.γχίνοια, on the other hand, is a nearnesr of mind ,-
nota reaching to the end, butan apprehension ol the best
means; not a perception of the nuth, buta perception of
how the truth is to be supported. lt is sometimes trans-
lated ‘sagacity‚’ but readiness or presence of mind is better,
as sagacity rather involves the idea of consideration. In
matters purely intellectual it is ready wit. It is a sort or
shorter or more limited εὐστοχία. lt is more of a natural
gift than εὖστοχία, because the latter is a far higher and
nobler faculty, and therefore rnore dependent forits per-
fection on cultivation, as all our highest faculties are.
Εὐστοχία is more altin to genius, ἀγχίνοια to practical
common sense.”
