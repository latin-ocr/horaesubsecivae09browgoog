viii Preface.

the last line of an odd doggrel verse that

comes into my head as Ι write-

“I wod not lyr all ways,
Ι wud nut ell cud;

But, I lneed nut fret about it,
'Gaas Ι cudn’t ef Ι wud.''

These Hours must, Ι fear, appear to many
Subseciviorer—idler than ever3 and some of
the studies-browner than brown. Ι had in-
· tended to sober them by two professional
papers-one‚ on the Doctrine and Praetice of
Prevention in Medicine; and the other, on
the Management of Convalescenee, how to
make the most of it; but these must wait
for that season which we may hope Felix
of old¹ did after all encounter, and they will.
For what is not mine, l am sure all my
readers will thank me; ¹and thank still more
the kind friend who has, through my· im-
portunity, allowed me to steal so much of
her “ Mystifications‚'' which lam mistaken

greatly if my readers do not relish and value.
