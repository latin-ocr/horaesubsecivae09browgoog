see it-the grave was made very deep, as he used
afterwards to tell υε, that it might hold us all-my
father first and abruptly let his cord drop, followed
by the rest. This was too much. Inow saw what ¹
was meant, and held on and fixed my fist and feet,
and I believe my father had some difficulty in forcing
open my small fingers; he let the little black cord
drop, and Ι remember, in my misery and anger,
seeing its open end disappearing in the gloom.

My mother's death was the second epoch in my l
father's life; it marked a change at once and for y
life; and for a man so self-reliant, so poised upon 3
centre of his own, it is wonderful the extent of
change it made. He went home, preached her l
funeral sermon, every one in the church in team,

himself outwardly unmoved.1 But from that time Ἴ

¹ Ι have been told that once in the course of the sermon
his voice trembled‚ and many feared he was about to break y

down.
