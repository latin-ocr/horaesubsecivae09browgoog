200 Horae Subsecivae.

winters of splendid darkness, and come and live l
with us like aChristian, we would go to an English ἐ
country-house, to Lady Masham's, at the Oates, l
the abode of comfort, cheerfulnesS, and thoughtful l
virtue, and we would there find John Loclre,
“ communing with the man within the breast,'' and ’
listening reverently, but like a man3 and we would
carry off from her ladyship's table her father’s (Cud-
worth) huge magazine of learning, strong intellect, χ
and lofty morality——his treatise “ concerning Eter- l
nal and immutable Morality.'' Then we might
call for Loclte's pupil Lord Shaltesbury, the great
man and the courtier, but the philosopher too,
having glimpses of better things, and coming very
close to what we are in search of-a special moral
faculty ,· and we would lind our friend Dr. Henry
More in his laboratory, dreaming in his odd Platonic
way, of a “ boniformfaculty.’'

Next, we would set sail across the Atlantic, and
reach in the evening the mild skies of the “ vex’t
Bermoothes‚'’ and there find the beautiful-souled

μ’ Berkeley dreaming of ideal universities in the far

west-osa new world, peopled with myriads as
happy, as intelligent, as virtuous as himself ς dream-
ing, too, of his pancratic “Tar Water,'' and in his
“ Siris’' ascending from his innocent nostrum, by a
Jacob's ladder of easy grade, to Plato's heaven.
