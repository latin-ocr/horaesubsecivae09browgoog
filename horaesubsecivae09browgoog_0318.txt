follows :··“ He (John Brown of Haddington)· had ,
now acquired so much of Greek as encouraged him
to hope that he might at length be prepared to reap
the richest of all rewards which classical learning
could confer on him, the capacity ol reading in the ’
original tongue the blessed New Testament of our
Lord and Saviour. F ull of this hope, he became .
¹ anxious to possess a copy of the invaluable volume.
One night, having committed the charge of his
sheep to a companion, he set out on a midnight
journey to St. AndrewS, a distance of twenty-four
miles. He reached his destination in the morning, .
and went to the bookseller’s shop, asking for a l

copy of the *Greek New Testament. The master
of the shop, surprised at such a request from a ³

shepherd boy, was disposed to make game of him.
Some of the professors coming into the shop ques·
tioned the lad about his employmiznt and studies.
After hearing his tale, one of thern desired the
bookseller to bring the volume. He did so, and
drawing it down, said, ‘Boy, read this, and you
shall have it for nothing.' The boy did so, ac·
quitted himself to the admiration of his judges, and
carried off his Testament, and when the evening
arrived, was studying it in the midst of his flock
on the braes of Abernethy.'’—Memoir of Rev. John
Broton of Haddington, by Rev. J. B. Patterson.
