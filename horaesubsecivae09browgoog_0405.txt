Notes on Art. 38 3

ἶ these well-meaning, zealous, deluded men who
’ have managed these “encouragements,’' have put
the progress of the nation in its power of knowing
and feeling truex Art.

One other heresyl must vent, and that is to
protest against the doctrine that scientific know-
ledge is of much direct avail to the artist3 it may
enlarge his mind as a man, and sharpen and
strengthen his nature, but the knowledge of ana·
torny is, Ι believe, more a snare than anything else
toan artist as such. Art is the tertium quid result·
ing from observation and imagination, with skill and
love and downrightness as their executors3 any-
thing that interferes with the action of any of these,
is killing to the soul of Art. Now, painting has to
do simply and absolutely with the surfaceS, with the
appearances oi things3 it knows and cares nothing
for what ¹is beneath and beyond, though if it does its
own part aright it indicates thern. Phidias and the

early Greeks, there is no reason to believe, ever
dissected even a monkey, much less a man, and yet

where is there such skin, and muscle, and substance,
and breath of life? When Art became scientific,
as among the Romans, and lost its heart in filling
its head, see what became of it: anatomy offensively
thrust ‚in your face, and often bad anatomy3 men
skinned and galvanized, not men alive and in action.
