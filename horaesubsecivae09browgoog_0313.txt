Letter to John Cairns, D.D. 291

and act truly, and said that much intellectual demo-
’ ralization and ruin resulted from neglecting this.
He was absolutely tolerant of all difference 01 opi-
nion, so that it was sincere3 and this was all the

more remarkable from his being the opposite of an

That in 0 spleen unfolds both heaven and earth,
And ere 0 man hath power to say ‘⁸ Behold !”
The jaws of darkness do devour it up ς

So quick bright things corne to confusion.‘

We remember once quoting these lines to 0 lady, and
being rather taken abach by her remark, ‘They are very
beautiful, but 1 don’t think they are true' We really had
forgot for the moment the straightforward, matter-of-fact
sense of which they are capable, and were not adverting
to the possibility of their being understood to mean that-
nothing but love-crosses are going, and that no tolerable
amount of comfort or happiness is to be found in the life
matrimonial, or in any of the approaehes towards it.
Every intelligent student of Shakspere, however, will at
once feel 11101 the poet's mind speedily passes away from
the idea with which he starts, and becomes merged in a
far wider theme, viz„ in the disenchantment· to which all
lofty imaginations are liable, the disappointment to which
all extravagant earthly hopes and wishes are doomed.
This, in fact, is distinctly expressed in the last line, and in
this sense alone 000 the words be regarded as at all touch-
ing or impressive. Sudden expansione and transitions of
thought, then, are nothing more than what is common to
all poetry, and when we find the Hebrew bards, in their
prophetie songs, mingling in the closest conjunction the
anticipatione of the glories of Solomon's reign, or the
happy prospecte of a return from Babylon, with the
higher glory and happiness of Messiah's advent, such tran-
sitions 01 thought are in perfect accordance with the 'ordi-
nary laws of poetry, and ought not to perplex even the
most unimaginative student of the Bible.'’
