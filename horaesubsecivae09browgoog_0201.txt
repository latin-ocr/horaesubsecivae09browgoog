Ῑῆῗ ι, R. CHALMERS used to say that in the
zl7 dynamics of human affairs, two qualities

s were essential to greatness-Power and

Promptitude. One man might have both, another
power without promptitude, another promptitude
without power. We must all feel the common
sense of this, and can readily see how it applies to
agenerai in the froid, to a pilot in a storm, toa
sportsman‚ to a iencer, to a debater. It is the
same with an operating surgeon at all times, and
may be at any time with the practitioner of the art
or healing. He must be ready for what are called
emergencies— cases which rise up at your feet, and
must be dealt with on the instantJ—he- must have
power and promptitude.

It is a curious condition or mind that this re-
quires: itis like sleeping with your pistol under
your pillow, and it on full cock3 a moment lost
and all may be lose There is the very nick of time.
