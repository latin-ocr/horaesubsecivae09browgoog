90 Hora Subsecivae.

preacher was to beat a neighbouring parish church,
and off we set, a cartful o'f irrepressible youngsters.
“ Calm was all nature as a resting wheel.'’ The
cmws, instead of making wing, were impudent and
sat still; the cart-horses were standing, knowing
the day, at the field-gates, gossiping and gazing,
idle and happy3 the moor was stretehing away in
the pale sun-light—vast, dim, melancholy, like a
sea ; everywhere were to be seen the gathering
people‚ “ sprinklings of blithe company;’' the
country-side seemed moving to one centre. As we
entered the kirk we saw a notorious character, a
drover, who had much of the brutal look of what

he worked in, with the knowing eye ofa man of ’

the city, a sort of big Peter Bell-

“He had a hardness in his eye,
He had a hardness in his cheek.”

He was our terror, and we not only wondered, but
were afraid when we saw him going in. The kirk
was full as it could hold. How different in looks
to a brisk town congregation! There was a fine
leisureliness and vague stare 3 all the dignity and
vacancy of animals3 eyebrows raised and mouths
open, as is the habit with those who speak little and
look much, and at far-off objects. The minister
comes in, homely in his dress and gait, but having
a great look about him, like a mountain among hills.
