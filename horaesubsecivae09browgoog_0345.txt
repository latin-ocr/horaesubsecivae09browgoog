Letter to John Cairns, D.D. 323

getting the Synod out of difficulties and confusions,
by some clear, tidy, conclusive “ motion ;'' and then
his speaking, so easy and bright and pithy, manly
and gentlemanly, grave when it should be, never
when it should not—mobile, fearless, rapid, brilliant
as Saladin—his silent, pensive, impassioned and em·
phatic friend was more like the lion-hearted Richard,
with his heavy mace3 he might miss, but let him
hit, and there needed no repetition. Each admired
the other; indeed Dr. Heugh's love of my father
was quite romantic; and though they were opposed
on several great public questions, such as the Apo-
crypha controversy, the Atonement question at its
commencement; and though they were both of
them too keen and too honest to mince matters

or be mealy-mouthed, they never misunderstood -

each other, never had a shadow of estrangement, so
that our Paul and Barnabas, though their conten-
tions were sometimes sharp enough, never “de-
' parted asunder ;’' indeed they loved each other the
longer the more.

Take him all in all, asa friend, as a gentleman,
as a Christian, asa citizen, Ι never knew a man so
thoroughly delightful as Dr. Heugh. Others had
more of this or more of that, but their was a sym-
metry,a compactness,a sweetness,a true delight-
fulness about him Ι can remember in no one else.
