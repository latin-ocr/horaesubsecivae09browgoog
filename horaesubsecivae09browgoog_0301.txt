26tk December 1856.

Mv noan soe-1 owe you my sincerest thanks for
your ltindness in favouring me with a sight of the volume
of Baxter's Life, which formerly belonged to my ancestrix,
Anna, Countess of Argyll. The Ms. note inserted by her
in it respecting her daughter is extremely interesting. I
had always been under the impression that the daughter
had died very shortly after her removal to France‚ but the
contrary appears from Lady Argyll’s memorandum. That
memorandum throws also a pleasing light on the later life
of Lady Anna, and forcibly illustrares the undying love
and tenderness of the aged mother, who must have been
very old when she penned it, the book having been printed
as late as 1696.

I am extremely obliged to you for communicating to me
this new and very interesting information-Believe me,
my dear Sir, your much obliged and faithful servant,

lruossr.
