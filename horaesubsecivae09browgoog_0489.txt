“ Oh, l’m Wat, Wat.” 467

The following is Mr. Chambers’s account of the
origin of this song :—Jessy Lewars had a call one
morning from Burns. He offered, if she would
play him any tune of which she was fond, and for
which she desired new verses, that he would do his
best to gratify her wish. She sat down at the
piano, and played over and over the air of an old
song, beginning with the words·-

“The robin catn' to the wren’s nest,

And keekit in, and keekit in:
Ὀ wae ’s me on your auld pow Ι

wad ye be in, wad ye be in?
Ye ’se ne'er get leave tolie without,

And 1 within, and Ι within,

As lang ’s Ι hae an auld clout,
To row ye in, to row ye in.' ”

Uncle now took his candle‚ and slunk off to
bed, slipping up noiselessly that he might not dis-

turb the thin sleep of the sufferes, saying in to him-
self—“I’d shelter thee, I'd shelter thee ;'' “ If

thou wert there, if thou wert there ;” and though
the morning was at the window, he was up by

eight, making breakfast for John and Many.
