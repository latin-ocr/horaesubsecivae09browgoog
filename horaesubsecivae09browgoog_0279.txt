Letter to John cairus, D.D. a 57

cherished collection, the ladies busy among the
wild grass and heather picking it up, and he full of
droil confusion and laughter.

The grey mare he had for many yearS. Ican
remember her small head and large eyes ; her neat,
conrpact body, round as a barrel; her finely flea·
bitten skin, and her thoroughbred legs. I have no
doubt she had Arabian blood. My father’s pride
in her was quite curious. Many a wild ride to and
from the Presbytery at Lanark, and across flooded
and shifting fords, he had on her. She was as
sweet-tempered and enduring‚ as she was swift and
sure 3 and her powers of running were appreciated
and applied in a way which he was both angry and
amused to discover. You know what riding the
bruse means. At a country wedding the young
men have a race to the bridegroom's home, and he
who win5‚ brings out a bottle and glass and drinks
the young wife's health. I wish Burns had de-
scribeda bruse3 all sorts of steeds, wild, unkempt
lads as well as colts, old broken-down thorough-
breds that did wonders when soopled, huge, grave,
cart horses devouring the road with their shaggy
hoofs, wilful punies, etc. You can imagine the
wild hurty-skurry and fun, the cornic situations and
upsets over a rough read, up and down places one
would be giddy to look at.
