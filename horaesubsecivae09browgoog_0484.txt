462 Horae Subsecivae.

When ΙΙ sleep I dream,
When I wauk l'rn cerie,
Sleep 1 can get nane,
For thinkin’ o’ my dearie.

Lanely nicht comes on,

A· the lave are sleepin'; ¹
I think on my true love,

And blear rny een wi' greetin'.

Feather beds are saft-
Pentit rooms are bonnie;

But ae kiss o' my dear love
Better 's far than ony.

O sor Friday nicht l—
Friday at the gloamin';

Ο for F riday nicht-
F riday's ¹lang o' comin' l ''

This love-song, which Mr. Chambers gives from
recitation, is, thinksUncle to himself, all but per-

fect3 Burns, who in almost every instance, not
only adorned, but transformed and purified what· ³
ever of the old he touched, breathing into it his ¹
own tenderness and strength, faiis here, as may be
seen in reading his version.

“ Oh, spring 's a pleasant time!
F lowers o' every colour—
the sweet bird builds her nest,
And l lang for my lover.
