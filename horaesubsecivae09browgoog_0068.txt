46 Horae Subsecivae.

“ 2. Thought'st thou that earthly Light

Could then assist thy Sight,

Or that the Limits of Reality
Could grasp Things fairer than
lxnagination's Span,

Who communes with the Angels of the sky,
Thou graspest at the Rainbow, and

Wouldst make it as the Zone with which thy Waist

is spanned !

‘¹ 3. And what find'st thou in his Stead?
Only the empty Bed!

Thou eought'st dee Earthly end therefoee
The heavenly is gone, for that must ever soar!

“ 4. For the bright World of

Pure and boundless Love

What hast thou found? alas! a narrow room!
Put out that Light,
Restore thy Soul its sight,

For better ’tis to dwell in outward Gloom‚
Than thus, by the vile Body's eye,
To rob the Soul of its Infinity!

“ ς. Love, Love has Wings, and he
Soon out of Sight will fiee,
Lost in far Ether to the sensual Eye,
But the Soul's Vision true
Can track him, yea, up to
The Presence and the Throne of the Most High:
For thence he is, and tho' he dwell below,
To the Soul only he his genuine Form will show !'’
