Vaughan’s Poems, ὅθι. 29

Who search'd it quite through to and fro,
And then, returning like the Sun,
Discover'd alt that there is done„

‘⁴ And since his death we throughly see
All thy dart way ;
Thy shzdes but thin and natrow be,
Which his first looks will quickly stay:

Mistt make but triumphs fot the duy.’'

Tun When-titt.

‘⁸ With what deep murmuro, through time’s siient steulth,
Doth thy transparent, cool and watry wealth
Here flowing fall,
And chide and call,
As if his liquid, loose Retinue staid
Lingring‚ and were of this steep place afraid.'’

Tau 'Suowuto

“ Waters above! Eternal springs!
The dew that silveri the Dove's wings!
Ο welcume, welcome to the sad!
Give dry dust drink, drinh that makes glad.
Many fair Evenings, many flowers
Sweetened with rich and gentle showets,
Have 1 enjoyed, and down have run
Many a fine and shiniog Sun3
But never, till this happy hour,
Was blest with such an evening shower!

What a cutious felicity about the repetition of
“ drink '' in the fourth line.
