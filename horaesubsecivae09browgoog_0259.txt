Letter to John Cairns, D.D. 237

torical, and ambitious, he became concentrated, ,

= urgent, moving (being himself moved), keen,
searching, unswerving, authoritative to herceness,
ᾗ full of the terrors of the Lord, if he could but per-
suade men· The truth of the words of God had
shone out upon him with an immediateness and
infinity of meaning and power, which made them,
though the same words he had looked on from
chiidhood, other and greater and deeper words,
He then left the ordinary commentatorS, and men
who write about meanings and flutter around the
circumference and corners; he was bent on the
centro, on touching with his own fingers, on seeing
with his own eyes, the pearl of great price. Then
it was that he began to dig into the depths, into the
primary and auriferous rock of Scripture, and take
nothing at another's hand: then he took up with
the word “ apprehend ;'' he had laid hold of the
truth,—there it was, with its evidence, in his hand 3
and every one who knew him must remember well
how, in speaking with earnestness of the meaning
of a passage, he, in his ardent, hesitating way,
looked into the palm of his hand as if he actually
saw there the truth he was going to utter. This
word apprehend played a large part in his lectures,
as the thing itself did in his processes of investi-
gation, or, if I might make a word, indigation.
