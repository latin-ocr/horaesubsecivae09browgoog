Letter to John Cairns, D.D. 243

Plutarch, Tacitus, and Lucian, down through
Boccaccio and Don Qrixote, which he knew by
heart and from the living Spanish, to Joseph An-
drews, the Spectator, Goldsmith and Swift, Miss
Austen, Miss Edgeworth, and Miss Ferrier, Galt
, and Sir Walter-he was as familiar with as with
ε David Crockat the nailer, or the parish minister,
2: the town-drummer, the mole-catcher, or the poach·
l ing weaver, who had the night before leistered a
ςῑ prime kipper at Rachan Mill, by the flare ofa tarry
u. wisp, or brought horne his surreptitious grey hen
h or maukin from the wilds of Dunsyre or the dreary
,h LangWhang.¹
y: This singular man came to the manse every
y· F riday evening for many years, and he and my
„l father discussed everything and everybody 3-be-
,u ginning with tough, strong head work-a bout at
,l wrestling, be it Caesar's Bridge, the Epistles of
{rr Phalaris, the import of μέν and δέ, the Catholic
question, or the great roots of Christian faith3

'uz ending with the latest joke in the town or the
lyr West Raw, the last effusion hy Affleck, tailor and
yn poet, the last blunder of AEsop the apothecary, and
jpu the last repartee of the village fool, with the wcek's

yon

¹With the practices of this last worthy‚ when carried
till on moderately, and for the sport's sale, he had a special

[omn sympathy.
