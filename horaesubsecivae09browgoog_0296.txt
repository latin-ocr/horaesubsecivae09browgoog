' love to be alone, and dwell with thoughts rather
than with thinkers, pervaded his entire character.
His religion was deeply personal,1 not only as affect-
ing himself, but as due to a personal God, and pre-
sented through the sacrifice and intercession of the
God-man 3 and it was perhaps owing to his “ con-
versation'’ being so habitually in heaven—his social
and affectionate desires filling themselves continually
from “all the fulness of God,'' through living faith
and love—that he the less felt the need of giving
and receiving human affection. l never knew any
man who lived more truly under the power, and
sometimes under the shadow of the world to come.
This world had to him little reality except as lead-

ing to the next3 little interest, except as the time ξ

of probation and sentence. A child brought to him
to be baptized was in his mind, and in his words,
“ a young immortal to be educated for eternity ;”
abirth was the beginning of what was never to end ς
sin—his own and that of the racc-was to him, as
it must beto all men who can think, the great
mystery, as it is the main curse of time. The idea
of it-—of its exceeding sinfulness—haunted and op-
pressed him. He used to say of John Foster, that

1 ln hie own words, “A personal Deity is the soul ol
Natural Religion3 a personal Saviour—the real living
Christ-is the soul of Revealed Religion.''
