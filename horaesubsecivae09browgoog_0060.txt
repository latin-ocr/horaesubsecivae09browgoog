38 Horae Subsecivae.

‘⁸ Unspoken tongues, perchanee in praise or wo,
Were character’d on tablets Time had swept3
And deep were haff their letters bid below
The thick small dust of those they once had wept.

“ No hand was here to wipe the dust away ;
No reader of the writing traced beneath3
No spirit sitting by its form of clay 3
No sigh nor sound from all the heaps of Death.

“ One place alone had ceased to hold its prey;
A form had press'd it and was there no mom
He garments os the Grave beside it lay,
Wbm once they wrapp'd him on the rocky floor.

“He only with returning footsteps brafe
· Tb' eternal calm wherewitb the Tomb was bound ,-

Among the slceping Dead alone He wake,
And bless'd with outstretch’d hands the bost around.

“ W ell is it that such blessing hovers here,
To soothe each sad survivor of the throng‚
Wbo haunt the portals of the solemn spbm,
And pour their wo the loaded air along.

“ lhey to the verge bavefollow'd what they love, .
And on tb' insuperable thresbold stand,
With cherisb'd names its speechless talm reprom,
And stretcb in the abyss their ungrasp'd hand.

“But vainly there they seek their soul'r relief,
And of th’ obdurate Grave its prey implore;

Till Death himself shall medicine their grief,
Closing their eyes by those they wept before.
