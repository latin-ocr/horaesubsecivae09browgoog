n Letter to John Cairnr, D.D. 307

me l '' It must not be supposed that the discourses
of “ Uncle Ebenezer,’' with these abrupt appeals
and -sudden starts, were unwritten or extempore3
they were carefully composed and written out,-
only these flashes of thought and passion came on
him suddenly when writing, and were therefore
quite natural when delivered-they came on him
again.

The Rev. John Belfrage, M.D., had more
power over my father’s actions and his relations to
the world, than any other of his friends: over his
thoughts and convictions proper, not much—few
living men had, and even among the mighty dead,
he called no man master. He used to say that the
three master intellects devoted to the study of
divine truth since the apostles, were Augustine,
Calvin, and Jonathan Edwards 3 but that even they
were only primi inter paren—this by the bye.

On all that concerned his outward life as a public
teacher, asa father, and as a member of society,
he consulted Dr. Belfrage, and was swayed greatly
by his judgment, as, for instance, the choice of a
profession for myself, his second marriage, etc.
He knew him to be his true friend, and not only
wise and honest, but pre-eminently a man of af-

fuirS, capax rerum. Dr. Belfrage was a great man

in posse, if ever I saw one,-—“ a village Hampden.’'
