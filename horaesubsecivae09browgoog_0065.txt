work, will understand our reference. If any one
wishes to read these really remarkable volumeS,
we would advise them to begin with “ Season
Changes '' and “ Emma, a Tale.'' We give two
Odeson Psyche, which are as nearly perfect as
anything out of Milton or Tennyson.

The story is the well-known one of Psyche and
Cupid, told at such length, and with so much
beauty and pathos and picturesqueness by Apuleius,
in his “Golden Ass.'' Psyche is the human soul
—a beautiful young woman. Cupid is spiritual,
heavenly love-a comely youth. They are mar-
. ried, and live in perfect happiness but by a strange
decree of fate, he comes and goes unseen, tarrying
only for the night3 and he has told her, that if she
looks on him with her bodily eye, if she tries to
break through the darkness in which they dwell,
then hc must leave her, and for ever. Her two
sisters—Anger and Desire, tempt Psyche. She
yields to their evil counsel, and thus it fares with
her :-

Ooe το Psrcns.

“ r. Let not a sigh be breathed‚ or he is flown!
With tiptoe stealth she glides, and throbbing breast,
Towards the bed, like one who dares not own
Her purpose, and half shrinks, yet cannot rest,
