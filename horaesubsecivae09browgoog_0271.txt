Letter to John Cairns, D.D. 249

“Come forth out of thy royal chambers, Ο thou
Prince of all the kings of the earth !’' and “ Truth,
indeed, came once into the world with her divine
Master,'’ or Charles Wesley's Hymns, or, most
loved of all, Cowper, from the rapt “ Come thou,
and, added to thy many crowns,'' or “ Ο that those
lips had language !” to the Jackdaw‚ and his incom-
parable Letters; or Gray's PoemS, Burns's “ Tam

O'Shanter,” or Sir Warter’s “ Eve of St. John,'’1
and “The Grey Brother.’'

But Ι beg your pardon: Time has run back with
me, and fetched that blessed past, and awakened its
echoes. Ι hear his voice; Ι feel his eye; I see his
whole nature given up to what he is reading, and
making its very soul speak.

Such a man then as Ι have sketched, or washed

faintly in, as the painters say, was that person who
sat in the corner under the gallery every Sabbath-

¹ Well do I remember when driving him from Mel-
rose to Kelso‚ long ago, we came near Sandyknowe, that
grim tower of Smailholm, standing erect like a warder
turned to stone, defying time and change, his bursting into
that noble baliad—

“ The Baton of Smaylho'rne rose with day,
He spurr'd his courser on,
W1thout stop ot stay, down the rocky way,
T hat leads to Brotherstone ;’'

and pointing out the “Watchfold height,'’ “the eiry
Beacon Hill,'' and “ Brotherstone.”
