18 Horae Subsecivae.

Soon after, he published alittle volume, called
“ Floret Solitudinis‚'' partly prose and partly verse.
The prose, as Mi. Lyte justly remarks, is simple
and nervous, unlike his poetry‚ which is occasion-
ally deformed with the conceit of his time.

. The verses entitled “ St. Paulinus to his wife

Theresia,’' have much ol the vigour and thought-
sulness and point of Cowper. In 1655, hc pub-
lished a second edition, or more correctly a re·

issue, for it was not reprinted, of his Silex Scintil-
lans, with a second part added. He seems not to
have given anything after this to the public, during
the next forty years of his lif .

He was twice married, and died in 1695, aged
73, at Newton, on the barrks of his beloved Uslr,
where he had spent his useful, blameless, and, we
doubt not, happy life; living from day to day in
the eye of Nature, and in his solitary rides and
walks in that wild and beautiful country, finding
full exercise for that fine sense of the beauty and
wondrousness of all visible thingS, “ the earth and
every common sight,’' ¹the expression of which he
has so worthily embodied in his poems.

In “The Recreate,'' he thus expresses this pas-
sionate love of Nature-

“ Happy those early dayes, when I
Shin'd in my Angell-inlancy!
