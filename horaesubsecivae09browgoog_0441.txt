Notas on Art. 419

though inferior and very different in subject, is not

less admirable in treatment. It consists of the
portraits of three sporting dogs. A retriever, with ⁴
its sonsy and affectionate visage, holding gingerly in

its mouth a living woodcock, whose bright and ,

terror-stricken eye is painted to the life. In the
centre is a keen thoroughgoing pointer, who has
just found the scent among the turnips· This is
perhaps the most masterly of the three, for colour
and for expression. The last is a livet-coloured
spaniel, panting overa plump pheasant, and look-
ing to its invisible master for applause. The touch
of genius is over them all, everywhere, from the
rich eye of the retriever to the wasted turnip leaves,
Yet there is no mere cleverness, no traces of handi-
work 3 you are not made to think of work at all,
till you have got your fill of pleasure and surprise,
and then you wonder what cunning hrain, and eye,
and finger could have got so much out of so little,
and so common. ”

We often hear of the decline of the Fine Arts in
our time and coun'try, but any age or nation might
well be proud of having produced within fifty years,
four 'such men as Wilkie, Turner, Etty, and Land-
seer.
