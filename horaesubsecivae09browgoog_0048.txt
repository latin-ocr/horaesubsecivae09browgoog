How Scmmnss.

“ Welcome‚ dear book, soul's Joy and Food! The feast
Of Spirits3 Heav'n extracted lyes in thee.
Thou art iife’s Chsrter, The Dove’s spotless nest
Where souls are hatch’d unto Eternitie.

“ In thee the hidden stone, the Manna lies 3

Thou art the great Elixir rare and Choite;
' The Key that opens to all Mysteries‚
The Word in characters, God in the Voice.’'

This is very like Herbert, and not inferior to him.

In a poem having the odd mark of “ih'' and
which seems to have been written after the death

“They are 211 gone into the world of light!
- And Ι alone sit lingring here!
Their very memory is fair and bright,
And my sad thoughts doth clear.

“ He that hath found some fledg'd hird's nest may know
At first sight if the bird be flowns

θ But what fair Deli or Grove he sings in now,
That is to him unknown.''

Referring to Nicodemus visiting our Lord :—

Tris Nrosrr. (Jonn 111. 2.)

“Most blest believer he!
Who in that land of darkness and blinde eyes

Thy long expected hesling wings could soe,
When thou didst rise3
