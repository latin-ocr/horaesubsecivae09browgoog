236 Horae Subsecivae.

The manse became silent; we lived and slept
and played under the shadow of that death, and‘we ;
saw, or rather felt, that he was another father than
before. No more happy laughter from the two in
the parlour, as he was reading Larry, the Irish post-
boy’s letter in Miss Edgeworth's tale, or the last
Waverley novel; no more visitings in a cart with ¹
her, he riding beside us on his white thorough-bred
pony, to Kilbuch0, or Rachan Mill, or Kirklawhill.

He went among his people as usual when they
were ill; he preached better than ever—they were ᾗ
sometimes frightened to think how wonderfully ἵ
he preached; but the sunshine was over—the glad
and careless look, the joy of young life and mutual
love. He was little with us, and, as I said, the
house was still, except when he was mandating his
sermons for Sabbath. This he always did, not only
viuri voce, but with as much energy and loudness as Ἴ
in the pulpit‚ we felt his voice was sharper, and r
rang keen through the house ἶ

What we lost, the congregation and the world l
gained He gave himself wholly to his work. As
you have yourself said, he changed his entire system {
and fashion of preaching3 from being elegant, rhe-

fine sentimenta and figures. After my mother’s death, he
preached in the same place, and Jean, running to her friend,
took the first word, ‘⁴ It’s α’ gowd noo.”
