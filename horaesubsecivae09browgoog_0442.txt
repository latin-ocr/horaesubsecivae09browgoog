THE EXECUTION OF LADY JANE GREY. i

There is an immediateness and calm intensity, a
certain simplicity and tragic tenderness‚ in this ex· Ἴ
quisite picture, which no one but Paul Delaroche
has in our days reached. You cannot escape its
power, you cannot fail to be moved3 it remains in
your mind as a thing for ever. lt is the last scene
of that story we all have by heart, of

“ Her most gentle, most unfortunate.'’

That beautiful, simple English girl, the young wife,
who has just seen the headless body of her noble
young husband carried past, is drawing to the close ¹
of her little life of love and study, of misery and
wrong. She is partially undressed, her women ‹
having disrobed her. She is blindfolded, and is
groping almost eagerly for the block3 groping as it ³
were into eternity; her mouth slightly open, her
face “ steady and serene.’' Sir John Gage, the
Constable of the Tower, is gently leading her by
the left hand to the block, and gazing on her with
a surprising compassion and regard—a very noble
head. Her women, their work over, are aside3
one fallen half-dead on the floor3 the other turning
her back, her hands uplifted and wildly grasping the
stone pillar, in utter astonishment and anguish.
