his every action, every letter he wrote, every lec·
ture he delivered, his last expiring breath, instinct
with the one constant idea that all truth, all good-
ness, all sciente, all beauty, all gladness are but the
expression of the mind and will and beart of the
Great Supreme. And this, in his case, was not
mysticism, neither was it merely a belief in revealed

religion, 'though no man cherished and believed in

God is indeed and in very truth all in all, that, to

whole creation, visible and invisible, spiritual and
material, everything that has being, is—to those
who have ears to hear-for ever declaring “Thou

Art,'' before the throne of the Great I ΑΜ.
