There is another garden ol Queen Mary’S,
which may still be seen, and which has been left
to itself like that in the Isle of Rest. Itis in
the grounds at Chatsworth, and is moated, walled
round, and raised about fifteen feet above the
park. Here the Queen, when a prisoner under
the charge of “Old Bess of Hardwake,” was
allowed to walk without any guard. How different
the two! and how different she who took her plea-
sure in thern!

Lines written on the steps of a small tnoated garden at
Chatsworth‚ called

And sad the darlr yew's shade3
The flowers which bloom in silence here,
ln silence also fade.
