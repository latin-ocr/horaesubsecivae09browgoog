was after were the real appearances of things,

of what goes on, and not less of what has been seen
and what has gone on, in this wonderful historic
earth of ours, with all its fulness. He was keen,
exact, capacious,-tranquil and steady in his gaze
as nature herself. He was, thus far, kindred to
Aristotle, to Pliny, LinnaeuS, Cuvier, and Hum- ἵ

Stagirite, had higher and deeper spiritual insights
than Edward F orbes ever gave signs of. It is
worth remembering that Dr. George Wilson was

and Remains for the press. Who will now take
up the tale?
