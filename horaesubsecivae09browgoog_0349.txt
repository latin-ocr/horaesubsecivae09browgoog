Letter to John Cairns, D.D. 327

And then, after a long and utter silence, his exclaim-
ing, “Is this the man according to God's own

¹ beart? Yes, it is; we must believe that both are

true.'' Then came Nathan. “There were two
men in one city, the one rich, and the other poor.
The rich man had exceeding many llocks and herds ;
but the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe
lamb ''-and all that exquisite, that divine sable-
ending, like a thunder-clap, with “Thou art the
man l ’' Then came the retribution, so awfully
exact and thorough,-the misery of the child’s
death ; that brief tragedy of the brother and sister,
more terrible than anything in AEschylus, in Dante,
or in F ord; then the rebellion of Absalom, with
its hideous dishonour, and his death, and the king
covering his face, and crying in a loud voice,
“O my son Absaloml O Absalom! my son! my
son l''-and David's psalm, “Have mercy upon
me, O God, according to thy loving·kindness;
according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies
blot out my transgressionS,''-then closing with,
“ Yes, ‘when lust hath conceived, it bringeth
forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth
forth death. Do not err,' do not stray, do not

transgress (μὴ πλανᾶσθε),1 ‘my beloved brethren,’

¹James‚ i. ις, 16. lt is plain that “do not err''
should have been in verse 1 yth.
