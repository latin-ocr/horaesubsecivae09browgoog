326 . Horae Subsecivae.

to a minute, James Chalmers-the old soldier and
beadle, slim, meek, but incorruptible by proffered
half-crowns from ladies who thus tried to get in
before the doors openedss-appemS, and all the people

in that long pew rise up, and he, followed by hi's ’
minister, erect and engrossed, walks in along the
seat, and they struggle up to the pulpit, We all
know what he is to speak of ; he looks troubled
even to distress ;-it is the matter of Uriah the Hit-
tite. He gives out the opening verses of the 5rst
Psalm, and offering up a short and abrupt prayer,
which every one takes to himself, announces his
miserable and dreadful subject, fencing it, as it were,
in a low, penetrating voice, daring any one of us to κ
think an evil thought; there was little need at that
time of the warning,—h'e infused his own intense,
pure spirit, into us all. Δ

He then told the story without note or comment, ,
only personating each actor in the tragedy with a
extraordinary effect, above all, the manly, loyal,
simple-hearted soldier. l can recall the shudder
of that multitude as of one man when he read,
“And it came to pass in the morning, that David
wrote aletter to Joab, and sent it hythe hand of
Uriah. And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye

Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and re- i

tire ye from him, that he may be smitten and die.’'
