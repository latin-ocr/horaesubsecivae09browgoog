Vaughan’s Poems, &a 27

And, what cnn never more hedone,
Did at midnight spcak with the Sun!

“ Ο who will tell me where
He found thee at that dead and silent honr?
Whnt hallow’d solitery ground did bear
So rare n flower3
Within whose sacred leaves did lie
The fulness of the Deityr

“ No mercy-reet of gold,
No dead and dusty Cherub, nor carved stone, ’
But his own living workr, did my Lord hold
And lodge alones
Where trees and herbs did warch and peep,
And wonder, while the Jews did sleep.

“ Denr night! thie world’r desem
The stop to husie f09h3 care'e check end curb;
The day of Spirits ς my soul’s calm retreat
Which none disturb!
Chrirt's¹ progress end his prayer time3
The honre to which high Heaven doth chime.

“ God's silent, reaching ssight:
When my Lord‘s head ir fflled with dew, and all
His locks are wet with the clear dropr of night ς
His still, eost call;
Hir knocking time3 the eonl's dumb watch, ,
When spirits their Fair Kindred catch.

¹⁸ Wcre all my lond, evil drys,
Cnlrn and unhaunted ae ie Thy dnrk Tent,

¹Mark i. 353 Luke xxi. 37.
