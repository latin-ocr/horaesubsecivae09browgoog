tence on the instant3 and next day, as William
was leaving for the High School, did he in the sour
morning, through an easterly haur, behold him
“whom he saved from drowning,'' and whom,

wirh better results than in the case of Launce an'd
Crab, he had taught, as isone should say “thus
would I teach adog,'’—dangling by his own chain

from his own lamppost,one of his hind feet just
touching the pavement, and his body preter-
naturally elongated.

William found him dead and warm, and falling
in with the milk-boy at the head of the street, ques-
tioned him, and discovered that he was the execu-
tioner, and had got twopence, he-Toby's every
moming's crony, who met him and accompanied
him up the street, and licked the outside of his can
-had, with an eye to speed and convenience, and
a want of taste, not to say principle and affection,
horrible still to think of, suspended Toby's anima·

tion beyond all hope. William instantly fell upon ·

him, upsetting his milk and cream, and gave him a
thorough licking, to his own intense relief 3 and,
being late, he got from Pyper, who was a martinet,
the customary palmies, which he bore with some-
thing approaching to pleasure. So died Toby: my
father said little, but he missed and mourned his
friend.
