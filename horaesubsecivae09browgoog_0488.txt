that are “winging the fervour of his love ;” not

even her soul; itis herself. This concentration ᾖ

. and eamestness, this perfervor of our Scottish love
poetry, seems to me to contrast curiously with the
light, trilling philandering of the English, indeed,
’ as far as Ι remember, we have almost no love·

songs in English, of the same class as this one, or

those of Burns. They are mostly either of the
genteel, or of the nautical (some of these capital),
or of9the comic school. Do you know the most
perfect, the finest love-song in our or in any lan-
guage3 the love being affectionate more than pas-
sionate, love in possession not in pursuit?

“ Oh, wert thou in the cauld blast
On yonder lea, on yonder lea,
My plaidie to the angry airt,
l’d shelter thee, l’d shelrer thee :
Or did Misfortune's bitter storms
Around thee blaw, around thee blaw,
Thy bield should be my bosom,
To share it a’, to share it α’.

“Or were Ι in the wildest waste,

See blaclr and bare, sae blaclr and bare,
The desert were a paradise,

If thou wert there, if thou wert there:
Or were Ι monarch o' the globe,

Wi' thee to reign, wi’ thee to reign,
The brightest jewel in mycrown

Wad be my queen, wad be my queen.''
