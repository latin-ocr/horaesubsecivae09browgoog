“012, I'm Wat, Wat.’' 2465

,t‘pentit rooms are bonnie ;'' I would infer from
this, that his “ dearie‚'’ his “ true love,'' was a-lass
'up at “the big house ''-a dapper Abigail possibly
——at Sir William's at the Castle, and then we have
,the final paroxysm upon Friday nicht—Friday at
the gloamin’ l⁴ O for Friday nicht l-Friday ’s lang
o' comin’ l-it being very likelyxThursday before
day-break when this affectionate ululatus ended in
repose.

Now, is not this rude ditty, made very likely by
some clumsy, big-headed Galloway herd, full of the
real stuff of love? He does not go off upon her
eye-brows, or even her eyes 3 he does not sit down,
and in a genteel way announce that “love in thine
eyes for ever sits,’' etc. etc., or that her feet look
out from under her petticoats like little mice: he is
far past that 3 he is not making love, he is in it.
This is one and a chief charin of Burns' love-songs‚
which are certainly of all love-songs except those
wild snatches left tous by her who flung herself
from the Leucadian rock‚ the most in earnest, the
tenderest, the “most moving delicate and full of
life.'' Burns makes you feel the reality and the
depth, the truth of his passion: it is not her eye-

lashes or her hose, or her dimple, or even

“A mole cinqne·spotted, like the crimson drops
l' the hottom of a cowslip‚'’'
