said, the lattice has been opened, and the breath of

i

the morning is flowing into the dark, stifling room. ¹

The night lamp has gone out, paling its ineffectual
sires, and its reek is curling up and down, and away.

This,asa piece of handiwork, is wonderful. When
you look narrowly into the picture, you see a chry· j

salis in the gloom‚ just opening its case, ready when
struck by the light and heat to expand and fly.

’ The sunlight throws across towards Borgia the rich Ἴ
blooms of the stained glasS, the light made glori· ¹

ously false in passing through its disturbing medium ;
while the pure, white light of heaven passes straight
down upon the Word of God‚and shines up into
the face of the young reader.

Such is a mere notion of this excellent picture3 it
s is painted throughout with amazing precision, deli-

some may be shocked, at the face, and hands, and
look of Luther‚ but let them remember where he
is, and what he has been and is doing and suffering.
This amount of pain gives a strange and true relish,
if it is taken up and overpowered and transfigured
into its opposite by our knowledge that it was to be
“but for a moment‚'' ¹and then the “ far more ex-
ceeding” victory and joy.
