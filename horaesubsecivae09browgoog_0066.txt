From her rosh Essay: in one trembling hand
, She bears a lamp, which sparhles on a sword3

ln the dim light she seems a wandering dream

Of loveliness: 'tis Psyche and her Lord,

Her yet unseen, who slumbers like a bearn

Of moonlight, vanishing as soon as scann'd!

But with seal’d eyes we hurty to the brinh,
Blind as the waterfall: oh, stay thy feet,

Of bliss than thy heart teaches thee, nor think
The sensual eye can grasp a form more sweet—

Softly she steals towards him, and bends o’er
His slusnberlidded eyes, as a lily droops
F aint 0’er a folded rose: one caress
She would but dares not take, and as she stood,
An oildrop from the lamp fell burning sore!

“ 4. Thereat sleepfray'd, dreamlike the God takes Wing
And soars to his own skies, while Psyche strives
To clasp his f00t‚ and fain thereon would cling,
But falls insensate;
