Happy Guessing. 189

¹ Mrs. Major Robertson‚ a woman of slight make,

great beauty‚ and remarkable energy, courage, and
sense (she told rne the story herself), on going up
to her bedroom at night-there being no one in the
house buta servant-girl, in the ground floor—saw
a portion ola man's foot projecting from under the
bed. She gave no cry of alarin, but shut the door
as usual, set down her candle‚ and began as if to
undress‚ when she said aloud to herself, with an
impatient tone and gesture, “ l’ve forgotten that
key again,I declare ;'’ and leaving the candle burn-
ing, and the door open, she went down stairs, got
the watchman, and secured the proprietor of the
foot, which had not moved an inch. How many
women or men could have done, or rather have

been all this!
