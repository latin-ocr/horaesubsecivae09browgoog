And though what Sir Walter says of the country «
surgeon is too true, that he is worse fed and harder
wrought thah any one else in the parish, except it
be his horse3 still, to a man like Vaughan, to
whom the love of nature and its scrutiny was a con-
stant passion, sew occupations could have furnished
ampler and more exquisite manifestations ol her
magnificence and beauty. Many of his finest de·
scriptions give us quite the notion of their having
been composed when going his rounds on his Welsh
pony among the glens and hills, and their unspeak·
able solitudes. Such lines as the following to a Star
were probably direct from nature on sorne cloudless
night :-

“ Whatever ’tis, whose beauty here below

Attracts thee thus, and makes thee stream and flow,

And winde and curle, and winlr and smile,
Shifting thy gate and guile.''

He is one of the earliest of our poets who treats

externa} nature subjectively rather than objectively,
in which he was followed by Gray (especially in his
letters) and Collins and Cowper, and in some mea-
sure by Warton, until it reached its consummati0n‚
and perhaps its excess, in Wordsworth.
