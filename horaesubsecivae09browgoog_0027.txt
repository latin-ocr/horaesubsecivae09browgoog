Vaughon's Poems, &a 5

Victor Cousin and “The Doctor‚ &c.” George Moir
and Madame de Suel, Dr. Fracastorius and Pro·
sessor Keble‚ Martinus Scriblerus and Sir Thomas
Browne‚ Macaulay and the Bishop of Cloyne,
Collins and Gray and Sir James Mackintosh, Haz-
litt and John Ruskin, Shakspere and Jackson of
Exeter, Dallas, De Quincey‚ and John Mill, and
the six Taylors—Jeremy, William, Isaac, jane,
John Edward, and Henry. We would have had
great pleasure in quoting what these famous women
and men have writte'n on the essence and the art
of poetry, and in showing how strangely they
differ, and how as strangely at times they agree.
But as it is not related at what time of the evening
our brisk young gentleman got his answer regard-
ing Dr. Channing, so it likewise remains untold
what our readers have lost and gained in our not
fulfilling our somewhat extensive desire.

It is with poetry as with flowers or fruits‚ and
the delicious juices of meats and fishes‚ we would
all rather have them, and smell them, and taste
them, than hear about them. It is a good thing
to know all about a lily, its scientific ins and outs‚
its botany, its archaeology, its aesthetics, even its ana-
tomy and “ organic radicals‚’' but it is a better thing

to look at itself, and “ consider’' it how it grows-
“ White‚ radiant, spotless, exquisitely pure.’'
