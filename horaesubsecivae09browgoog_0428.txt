406 Horae Subsecivae.

new sensation, a new anda higher notion' of what
the mind of man can put int0, and bring out of,

landscape painting3 how its representative and sug-

gestive truthfulness may be perfect, forming the
material elements,-—the body, as: it were, of the
picture,-while, at the same time, there may be
superadded that fine sense of the undefinable rela-
tion of the visible world to mental emotion, which
is its essence and vivifying soul. ·

How original, how simple, its composition!
That tall tree, so inveterately twisted on itself,
dividing the scene into two subjects, each contrast-
ing with and relieving the other; the open country
lying under the full power of the flaming mid-day
sun ; and that long alley, with its witchery of gleam
and shadow, its cool air,a twilight of its own, at
noon!

Nothing is more wonderful about Turner than

the resolute way in which he avoids all imitation, l

even when the objects are in the very foreground
and clearly defined. He gives you an oak, ora
beech, or an elm, so as to be unmistakable, and yet
he never thinks of giving their leaves botanically, so
as that we might know the tree from a leaf. He
’ gives us it not as we know it, but as we should see
it from that distance3 and he gives us all its charac-
teristics that would carry that length, and no more.
