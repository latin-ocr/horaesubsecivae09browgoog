the pursuit, and the practice of truth in everything;
strength and depth, rather than external warmth of
affection3 fidelity to principles and to friends. He
used often to spealt of the moral obligation laid ,
upon every man to think truly, as well as to speak

ter was afforded, we used to think, by the decided and ,
almost contemptuous manner in which he always rejected

the theory of what is called the double interpretation of ,
prophecy. This, of course, is not the place to discors
whether he was absolutely right or wrong in his opinion. ᾖ
. The subject, however, is one of somewhat curious intc- ³
rest, and it has also a strictly literary as well as a theologi·

cal aspect, and what we have to say about it shall relate ¹
exclusively to the former. When Dr. Brown then said,

as he was accustomed in his strong way to do, that ‘if ,
prophecy was capable of two senses, it was impossible it ·
could have any sense at all,' it is plain, we think, that he
forgot the specific character of prophetie literature, viz„

its being in the highest degree poetic. Now every one
lmows that poctry of a very elevated cast almost invari-
ably possesses great breadth, variety, we may say multi-
plicity of meaning. Its very excellence consists in its
being capable of two, three, or many meanings and appli- ,
cations. Tale, for example, these familiar lines in the
‘Midsummcr Night's Dream :'-

‘Ah me! fot aught that ever 1 could read,
Could ever hear by tale or history,

The course of true love never did run smooth:
But either it was different ln blood,

Or else misgraffed in respect of years,

Or else it stood upon the choice of friends ᾗ
Or if there were a sympathy in choice,
War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,
Malting it momentary aa a sound,

Swift as a shadow‚ short aa any dream,
Brief as the lightning in the collied night,
