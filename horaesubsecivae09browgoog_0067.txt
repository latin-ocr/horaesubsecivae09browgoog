Vauglan's Poems, &a 45

’ Psyche! thou shouldst have taken that high gift
Oflove as it was meant, that mystery

Did aslt thy faith, the Gods do test out worth,
And ere they grant high boons our heart would siit!

“ ς. Hadst thou no divine Vision of thine own?
Didst thou not see the Object of thy Love
Clothed with a Beauty to dull clay unknown?
And could not that bright lmage, far above
The Reach of sere Decay, content thy Thought?
Which with its glory would have wrapp’d thee round,
To the Gravesbrinlt, untouched by Age or Pain!
Alas! we mar what Fancy’s Womb has brought

Forth of rnost beautiful, and to the Bound
Of Sense reduce the Helen of the Brain ! '⁹

What a picture! Psyche, pale with love and
sear, bending in the uncertain light, over her lord‚
with the rich flush of health and sleep and man·
hood on his cheek‚ “ as a lily droops saint o’er a
solded rose!’' We temember nothing anywhere
finer than this.

Ona το Psvctrt.

“ 1. Why stand'st thou thus at Gaze
In the faint Tapersrays,
With strain'e'd Eyeballs fitted upon that Bed?
Has he then llown away,
Lost, lilte a Star in Day,
Or like a Pearl in Depths unlathomdd?
Alas! thou hast done very ill,

Thus with thine Eyes the Vision of thy Soul to kill!
