“ Wonder! but-for we cannot comprehend‚
, Dare not to doubt. Man, know thyself! and know
That, being what thou art, it must be so.
We creatores are, and it were to transcend
The limite of our being, and ascend
Abone the Infinite, if we could show
All that He is and how things from Hisn flow.
Things and their laws by Man are grasp'd and kenn’d,
But creatores must no more; and Nature's must
Is Reason's choice3 for could we all reveal
Of God and acts creative, doubt were just.
Were these conceivable, they were not real.
Here, ignorsnce man's sphere of being suits,
'Tis knowledge sels, or of her richest fruita.

¹“ Then rest here, brother! and within the veil
Boldly thine anchor cast. What though thy boat
No shoreland sees, but undulates afloat
On soundless depths3 securely fold thy sail.
Ah! not by daring prow and favouring gaie
Man threads the gulfs of doubting and despond,
And gains a rest in being unbeyond,
Who roams the furthest, surest is to fai13
Knowing nor what to seelr, nor how to find.
Not far but near, about us, yea within,
Lieth the infinite life. The pure in mind
Dwell in the Presence, to themselves ahin;
And lo! thou siek and health-imploring soul,
He stands beside thee-touch, and thou art whole.''
