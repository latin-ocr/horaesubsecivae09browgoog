204 Horae Subsecivae.

but in no wise pointing the way to a paradise to be
regained.

And before settling at home, we would look in 3
and pay our respects in our own town, to 3 bene-
ficent, benevolent, enlightened, and upright man,¹ l
with whom we could agree to differ in some ἶ
things, and rejoice to agree in many3 and we
would bring away from him all that he could tell ζ
usos that “ conscientiousness ’'—the bodily organ ³
of the inward sense of personal right and wrong, Ἴ
upon the just direction of which-no one knows ¹
better than he does-depend the true safety, 3ηά
dignity, and happiness of man.

But after all our travel, we would be little the ἵ
better or the wiser, if we ourselves did not in· ss
wardly digest and appropriate, as “ upon soul and ἵ
conscience,'’ all our knowledge. We would much
better not have left horne. For it is true, that not
the light from heaven, not the riches from the
earth, not the secrets of nature, not the minds of
men, or of ourselves, can do us anything but evil,
if our senses, our inward and outward senses, are
not kept constantly exercised, so as to discern for
ourselves what is good and evil in us and for us.
We must carry the lights of our own conscious· χ
