I refer my readers to what he says on Ἀγχίνοια and ᾗ

¹ As l arn now, to my sorrow and shame, too much of y
a mediate Grecian, 1 give a Balliol friend's note on these χ
two words :—“ What you have called ‘presence of mind' ί
and ‘happy guessing' may, 1 think, ¹be identified respec- ,

tively with Aristotle’s ἀγχίνοια and εὐστοχία, The latter

or these, εὐστοχία, Aristotle mentions incidentally when 2

treating of εὐβουλία, or good deliberation. Etb. Nic. blr.

the end, the rapid, and, as it were, intuitive perception ol
the trurh. This is what Whewell means by saying, ‘all

induction is a happy conjecture.' But when Aristotle ν

says that this faculty is not guided by reason (ἀνευ τε γὰρ
