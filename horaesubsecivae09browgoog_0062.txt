40 ¹ Horae Subsecivae.

The healing aid of thine ensurined power
To veil the past-and bid the time good speed!

‘¹ 1 gather it-it withers on my breast ς
The heart's·ease dies when it is laid on mine;
Methinls there is no shape by Joy possess'd,
Would better fare than thou, upon that shrine.

‘¹ Tale from me things gone by—oh! change the past-
Renew the lost-restore me the decay'd 3-
Bring back the days whose tide has ebb’d so fast—
Give form again to the fantastic shade!

“My hope, that never grew to certainty,—
My youth, that 'perish'd in its vain desire,—

My fond ambition, crush'd ere it could be

Aught save a aelf-consuming, wasted lire:

“ Bring these anew‚ and set me once again
ln the delusion of Life's Insancy-
l was not happy, but Ι knew not then
¹That happy I was never doom’d to be.

“ Till these things are, and powers divine descend—
Love, ltindness, joy, and hope, to gild my day,
Δ ln vain the emblem leaves towards me bend,
Thy Spirit, Heart’s-Ease is too far away l ’'

We would fain have given two poems entitled
“Bessy'' and “Youth and Age.’' Everything
in this little volume is select and good. Sensibility

and sense in right measure and proportion and
keeping‚ and in pute, strong, classical language3
