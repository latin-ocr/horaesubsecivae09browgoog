342 - Horae Subsecivae.

the insensibility or lethargy of paralytic disease, but
having the mind calm and clear, and the body con· ,
scious of its own decay,-dying, as it were, in cold
blood. One thing Ι must add. That morning i
when you were obliged to leave, and when “ cold
obstruction’s apathy ” had already begun its reign- ’ ¹
when he knew us, and that was all, and when he .
followed us with his dying and loving eyes, but ji
could not speak-the end came; and then, assi y
through life, his will asserted itself supreme in ³
death. With that love of order and decency whieh Ι
was a law of his life, he deliberately composed
himself, placing his body at rest, as if setting his
house in order before leaving it, and then closed his ³
eyes and mouth, so that his last look—the look his
b‘ody carried to the grave and faced dissolution in·-

was that of sweet, dignilied sels-possession.

I have made this letter much too long, and have

said many things in it Ι never intended saying, and
omitted much I had hoped to be able to say. But
Ι must end.

Yours ever affectionately‚

J. Bnown.
