ever he hit. But from this very vehemente, this

haste, there was in ¹his general style a want of cor·

rectness, of selectness, of nicety, of that curious
feliciry which makes thought immortal, and en-
shrines it in imperishable crystal. ln the language
of the affectione he was singularly happy; but, in a
formal statement, rapid argumentation and analysis,
he was often as we might think, uncouth, and im·
perfect, and incorrect: chiefly owing to his tem·
perament, to his fiery, impatient, swelling spirit,
this gave his orations their fine audacity—this

could not but spealt the things he had seen and felt, and j
heard and believed; and he did it much in the same way, ³

and in the same words, for the thoughts and affectione and
posture of his soul were the same. Like all men of vivid
perception and leen sensibility, his mind and his body
continued under impressione, both material and spiritual,
after the objects were gone. A curious instance of this
occurs tous. Some years ago, he roamed up and down
through the woods near Auchindiuny‚ with two boys as
companions. lt was the first burst of summer, and the
trees were more than usually enriched with leaves. He
wandered about delighted‚ silent, loolring at the leaves,
“ thick and numbetless.'' As the three went on, they
came suddenly upon a high briclt wall, newly built, for
peach trees, not yet planted. Dr. Chalmers halted‚ and
loolting steadfastly at-the wall, exclaimed most earnestly‚
“What foliage! what foliage !'' The boys loolred at one
another, and said nothing; but on getting home, expressed
their astonishment at this very puzaling phenomenon.
What a differente! leaves and parallelograms3 a forest
and a briclt wall!
