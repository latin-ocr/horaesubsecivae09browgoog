214 Horae Subsecivae.

F erriar, Gooch‚ are all the more powerful, and all

the more permanent as medical authorities, from ’

their having learned, by practice and by example, to

write forcibly, clearly, compactly, and with dignity η

and grace.

The turbid, careless style, constipated, or the ’

reverse, by which much of our medical literature is
characterized, is a disgrace to our age, and to the
intelligence, good taste, and good breeding of our

profession, and mars inconceivably the good that ,

lies concealed and bungled within it. ·No man has
a right to speak without some measure of prepara-
tion, orderliness, and selectness. As Butler says,

“Confusion and perplexity of writing is indeed

without excuse, because any one, if he pleases, may

know whether he understands and sees through what 5

he is about 3 and it is unpardonable for aman to lay
his thoughts before others, when he is conscious
that he himself does not know whereabouts heis,
or how the matter before him stands· It is coming
abroad in disorder, which he ought to de athamed to
find himself in at homr.'' Whately, in reply to a youth
may be read alongside of Collingwood's from his ship to
his daughters, and his Jasper Wilson Letter to Mr. Pitt
is one sustained burst of eloquent and earnest patriotism,
of sound political philosophy, and strong semet it was

flpng off at a heat, and was his only appearance in public
a arrs.
