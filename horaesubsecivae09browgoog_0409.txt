Notes on Art. 387

DISTRAINING FOR RENT.

Or this picture it is not easy to speak. We do
not at first care to say rnuch about feelings such
as it produces, lt is, to our liking, Wilkie's most
perfect picture. If they were all to be destroyed
but one, we would keep this. His “ Blind Man's
Buff,” his “ Penny Wedding,'' his “ Village Poli-

ticians‚'' and many others, have more humour,-

And what is more, and be'tter than all this, everywhere
throughout this work, we trace evidentes of a deep reve·
rence and godly sear-a perpetual, though subdued ac·
knowledgment of the Almighty‚ as the surn and substance,
the beginning and the ending of all truth, of all power, of Ι
all goodness‚ and of all beauty.

“This book (Modern Painters) contains more true
philosophy, inore information of a strictly scientific lind,
more original thought and exact observation of nature,
more enlightened and serious enthusiasm, and more elo·
quent wriring, than it would be easy to match not merely
in worhs of its own class, but in those of any class what-
ever. It gives us a new, and we think, the only true
theory of beauty and sublimity3 it asserts and proves the
existence of a new element in landscape painting, placing
its prince upon his rightl'ul throne3 it unfolds and illus-
trates, with singular lorce, variety, and beauty, the laws
of art3 it explains and enlorces the true nature and specilic
function of the imagination, with the precision and fulness
of one having authority,-and all this delivered in language
which, sor purity and strength and native richness, would
not have dishonoured the early manhood of Jeremy Τ ay-
lor, of Edmund Burlre‚ ot of the author's own favourite

Richard Hoolrer.”-J. Β.
