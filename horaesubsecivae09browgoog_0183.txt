Duchie. 161

with the full use of her ears3 quite as great a pet,
in a word, of us all as Duchie was of ours. One
day we found her mourning the death of a cat,a
great playfellow of the Sputchard'S, and her small
Gracc was with us when we were condoling with
her, and we saw that she looked very wistfully at

Duchie. Ι wrote on the slate, “ Would you like Β

her ?” and she through her tears said, “ You know
that would never d0.'' But it did do. We left
Duchie that very night, and though she paid us fre·
quent visits, she was Cousin Susan's for life. l
fear indulgence dulled her moral sense. She was
an immense happiness to her mistress, whose silent
and lonely days she made glad with her oddity and
mirth. And yet the small creature, old, toothless,
and blind, domineered over her gentle friend-
threatening her sometimes if she presumed to re-
move the small F ury from the inside of her own
bed, into which it pleased her to creep. Indeed,l
believe it is too true, though it was inferred only, ι
that her mistress and friend spent a great partos a
winter night in trying to coax her dear little ruffian
out of the centre of the bed. One day the cook
asked what she would have for dinner: “ Ι would
likea mutton·chop, but then, you know, Duchie
likes minced veal better ! ’' The faithful and happy
little creature died at a great age, of natural decay.
