Letter to John Cairns, D.D. 271

· was part of our ol'd Scottish severe unsparing cha-
racter—calm to coldness outside, burning to herce-
ness, tendet to agony within.

I was saying how much my father enjoyed
women’s company. He liked to look on thern,
and watch them, listening1 to their keen, uncon-
nected, and unreasoning, but not unreasonable talk.
Men's argument, or rather arguing, and above all
debating, he disliked. He had no turn for it. He
was not combative‚ much less contentious. He
waS, however, warlike. Anything that he could
destroy, any falsehood or injustice, he made for, not
to discuss, hut to expose and kill. He could not

fence witli his mind much less with his tongue‚ and

had no love for the exploits of a nimble dialectic.
He had no readiness either in thought or word for
this 3 his way was slowly to think out a subject, to

get itwell “ bottomed,'' as Locke would say3 he .

¹ One day my mother, and her only sister, Agnes—
married to James Aitlren of Callands, a man before his
class and his time, for long the only Whig and Seceder
laird in Peeblesshire, and with whom my father shared
the Edinburgb Review from its beginning-the two sisters
who were, the one to the other, as Martha was to Mary,
sat talking of their household doings ; my aunt was great
upon some things she could do; my father looked up from
his book, and said, “There is one thing, Mrs. Alelen,
you cannot do-you cannot turn the heel of a stocking ;”
and he was right, he had noticed her make over this
“ little'' turn to her mother.
