out betimes with our gold, that we may spend it
and get “goods'' fovit, and when we can look
forth on that ample world of daylight which we.
can never hope to overrun, and into that overarch-

ning and sudden tempest‚ there is revealed to those
who look for thern, lucid openings into the pure,
deep empyrean‚ “as it were the very body of ’
heaven in its ‘clearness;'' and when, best of all,
we may remember Who it is who stretched out
these heavens ,as a tent to dwell in, and on whose
footstool we may kneel, and out of the depths of
