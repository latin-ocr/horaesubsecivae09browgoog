412 Horae Subsecivae.

plaything, the other the food, the elixir of the soul. ἲ

All great poete, as Homer, Shakspere, Milton, and
Burns, have both faculties, and find lit work for
each3 and so have the great painters, Titian, Vero-
nese, Albert Durer, Hogarth, Wilkie. We suspect
Mr. Maelise has little else than fancy, and makes it
do the work of both. There must be something
radically defective in the higher qualities of poetic
sensibility and ideality in any man who could, as he
has done in the lately published edition of Moore's
MelodieS, execute some hundreds of illustratione,
without above three or four of them being such as
you would ever care to see again, or, indeed, would
recognise as having ever seen before.

We would not give such sweet humour, such l
maidenly simpleness‚ such exquisite mirth‚ such ,
“ quips‚ and cranlm, and wauton wiles,” as we can
get in most of the current numbers of “ Punch,'' κ
from the hand of young Richard Doyle (1846), i
with drawing quite as astonishing‚ and far more ex-
pression,-for this sumptuous three-guinea quarto.
Have our readers six and sixpence to spare ?—then
let them furnish wholesome fun and “ unreproved
pleasure'' for the eyes and the minds of the small
men and women in the nursery, by huying “The

. F airy Ring,'’ illustrated by him.
