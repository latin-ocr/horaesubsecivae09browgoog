Notes on Art. 429

NAPOLEON CROSSING THE ALPS.

Last year at this time we were all impressed, as
we seldom are by anything of this sort, by Dela-
roche's picture of Napoleon at F ontainebleau. We
are none of us likely to forget the feeling then expe-
* rienced of being admitted into that dread presence,
and looking, not only at the bodily form, but into
the very soul of that great and miserable man. We
may now get a different and yeta similar impres-
sion, from what we cannot but regard asa nobler
and more touching work-something deeper and
finer still. Those who knew what we thought of
the first, will understand how much praise of the
second is involved in our saying this. Last year we
saw before us the spectacle of power, perhaps the
most intense and enormous ever committed by the
Divine Disposer to one of his creatores, in ruins,
having all but played the game out. It was the
setting sun of a day of astonishment, brightness and
tempest, lightning and thunder3 but the great orb
was sinking in disastrous storm and gloom—going
down never to rise again. In this new picture, we
have the rising sun climbing up its young morning
sky; the hours of glory, of havoc, and of shame,
are before him, and us. The innocent brightness of
his new-born day is not yet gone 3 it will soon go.
