78 Horae Subsecivae.

ἔπειτα πέδονδε κυλίνδετο λᾶας ἀναιδής, vires acquirens
eundo,· how the great and good man was totus in
illo ,· how he spoke t0, upbraided him, cheered him,
gloried ln him, all but prayed for him,—how he
joked philosophy to his wondering and ecstatic
creW, when he (the stone) disappeared among
some brackense-telling them they had the evi-
dence of their senses that he was in, they might
even know he was there by his effects, by the
moving brackens‚ himself unseen3 how plain it
became that he had gone in, when he actually
came out l—how heran up the opposite side a bit,
and then fell back, and lazily expired at the bot-
tom,-how to their astonishment, but not dis-
pleasure—for he “set them off so well,'' and
“was so furrny'’-he took from each his cherished
stone, and set it off himself l showing them how
they all ran alike, yet differently; how he went on,
“ making,'' as he said, “an induction of parties-
lars,” till he came to the Benjamin of the flock, a
wee wee man, who had brought upa stone bigger ¹
than his own big head; then how he let him,
unicus omnium, set off his own, and how wonder-
fully rr ranl what miraculous leaps: what es-
capes from impossible places: and how it ran up
the other side farther than any, and by some felicity
remained there. ’
