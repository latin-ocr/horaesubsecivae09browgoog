110 . Horae Subsecivae.

To George Wilson, to all such men—and this is

the great lesson of his life-the heavens are for ever
telling His glory, the firmamentis for ever showing
forth His handiworlt3 day unto day, every day, is
for ever uttering speech, and night unto night is
showing knowledge concerning Him. When he
considered these heavens, as he lay awake, weary,
and in pain, they were to him the work of His
fingers. The moon, walking in brightness, and
lying in white glory on his bed-the starsss-were by
Him ordained. He was a singularly happy, and i
happy-making man. No one since his boyhood
could have suffered more from pain, and languor,
and the misery osan unable body. Yet he was
not only cheerful, he was gay, full of all sorts of
fun—genuine fun—and his joltes and queer turns
of thought and word were often worthy of Cowper
or Charles Lamb. We wish we had thern col-
lected. Being, from his state of health and his
knowledge in medicine, necessarily “ mindful of
.death,'' having the possibility of his dying any day
or any'hour, always before him, and “that undis-
co'vered country'' lying full in his view, he must-
taking, as he did, the right notion of the nature of
things—have had a peculiat intensity of pleasure in
the every-day beauties of the world.
