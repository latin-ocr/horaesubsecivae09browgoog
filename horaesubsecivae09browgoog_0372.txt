3 50 Horae SubsecivaeJ

Scott of Gilhorn used to grind lilts out o’ an auld
kist to wauken her visitors i' the mornin'.

“And some o’ thern didna like it sair, tho’ nane
o’ them had courage to tell her sae, but Anny
Graham o' Duntrune.

“ ‘Lord forgie ye,' said MrS. Scott, ‘ye'll no

gae to heaven, if ye dinna like music 3’ but Anny y

was never at a loss for an answer, and she said, ἵ

‘Mrs. Scott—heaven's no the place I tak it to
be, if there be auld wives in ‘t playing on hand-
organs.' ''

Many a story did MrS. Ramsay tell. The party

drew their chains close to the sofa, and many a

joke she related, till the room rung again with
the merriment, and the laird, in ecstasy‚ caught
her round the waist‚ exclaiming “ Oh ltye are a

canty wifie.⁵’
The strangers seemed to think so too; they ab· ἕ

solutely hung upon her, and she danced reels first 1

with the one, and then with the other, till the
entrance of a servant with the newspapers produced
a seasonable calm.

They lay, however, untouched upon the table
till Mrs. Ramsay requested some one to read over
the claims that were putting in for the King’s coro-

nation, and see if there was any mention of hers.
“What is your claim ?” said Mt. Sandford.
