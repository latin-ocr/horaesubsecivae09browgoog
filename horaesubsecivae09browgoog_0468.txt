446 Horae Subsecivae.

'pursuing'' If you look steadily into that face you
will see that the bones of the mighty Reformeffs l
face, so well known to ue, are all there, and need
but good food and sleep‚ and the open air, and
peace of mind, and the joy of victorious faith and
work, to fill it up, and make it plump, giving it
that look of energy in repose, of enough and to
spare, of masculine power, which that broad, mas·
sive, but soft and kindly visage, wears written all
over it; and the slightly upturned head, the clear,
open, deep eyes, and that rich chin and neck,
“ dewlapped like a Thessalian bull.'' ,
And we know that all this misery, and examina·
tion, and wasting are true. We know that when
his friend Alexis was struck down dead by lightning
· at his side as they walked together, he also was
struck down in his mind 3 and in the words oi
Principal ,Tulloch in his admirable sketch, he car· l
ried out his resolve in a way curiously and entirely l
his own-“ One evening he invites some of his ³
fellow-students to supper, gives thern of his best
cheer, music and jest enliven the company, and
the entertainment closes with a burst of merri-
ment. The same night there is a solitary knock
at the door of the Augustinian Convent, and,
two volumes alone of all his books in his hand-

Plautus and Virgil-Luther passes under its portal.'’
