Dr. George Wilson. 111

“ The common sun, the air, the elles,
To him were opening Paradise.’'

They were to him all the more exquisite, all the
more altogether lovely‚ these Pentlands and the
Braid Hills, and all his accustomed drives and
places; these rural solitudes and pleasant villages
and farms, and the countenances of his friends,
and the clear, pure, radiant face of science and
of nature, were to him all the more to be desired
and blessed and thankful for, that he knew the
pallid king at any time might give that not unex-
pected knock, and summon him away.
