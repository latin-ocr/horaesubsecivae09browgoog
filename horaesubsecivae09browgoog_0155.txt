“strange woman.'' “Did she drink ?'' “ Whiles.’'

On the day of the ¹¹funeral one or two residents

in the close-accompanied him 'to 'the Canongate'
Churchyard. He observed a decent-looking little
old woman watehing thern, and following at a· dis-.
tance‚ though the day was wetv and bitter. After
the grave was filled, and he had taken off his hat,

maining 3 she ¹carne up and, ,courtesying said, “*Ye
wad ken that lass, Sir?’' “JYes3 l knew her
when she was young.’' The'woman then burst
N into tears, and told Hugh that she “ keepit a bit
shop at the Closs-mouth, and 'Mary dealt wi' me,
and aye pald teglat, and I was feared she was dead,'
for she had been a month awin’ tne half-a-crown :’'
