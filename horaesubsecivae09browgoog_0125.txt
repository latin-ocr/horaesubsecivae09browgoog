Dr. George Wilson. 103

ἵ mistry‚ and make a Cosmos where now there is

endless agglomeration and confusion,—would, in a
word, do for the science of the molecular constitu-
tion of matter and its laws of action and reaction
at insensible distances, what Newton's doctrine of
gravitation has done for the celestial dynamics.
For, let it be remembered, that the highest specu-
, lation and proof in this department-by such men
as Dumas, Faraday‚ and William. Thomson, and
others—points in this direction3 it does no more as
yet perhaps than point, but some of us may live to
see “ resurgam '' inscribed over Samuel Brown's un-
timely grave, and applied with gratitude and honour
to him whose eyes closed in darkness on the one
great object of his life, and the hopes of whose
“ unaccomplished years '⁹ lie buried with him.
Very different from either, though worthy of and
capable of relishing much thatwas greatest and best
in both, was he whom we all loved and mourn‚ and
, who, this day week‚1 was carried by such a multi-
tude of mourners to that grave, which to his eye
had been open and ready for years.
George Wilson was born in Edinburgh in 1818.
l His father, Mt. Archibald Wilson, was a wine
merchant, and died sixteen years ago ; his mother,
Janet Aitken‚ still lives to moum and to remember

¹ hdonday‚ zllth November 18 59.
