244 Horra Subrecivae.

Edinburgh and Glasgow news by their respective
carriers3 the whole little life, sad and humorous
-who had been born, and who was dying or dead,
married or about to be, for the past eight days.1

This amused, and, in the true sense, diverted
my father, and gratified his curiosity, which was
great, and his love of menas well as for man.
He was shy, and unwilling to ask what he longed
to know, liking better to have it given him without
the asking; and no one could do this better than
“ Uncle Johnston.''

You may readily understand what a thorough
exercise and diversion of an intellectual and social
kind this was, for they were neither of them men
to shirk from close gripeS, or trifle and flourish
with their weapons; they laid on and spared not.
And then my uncle had generally some special nut

of his own to crack, some thesis to lling down and r

offer battle on, some “ particle '¹ to energize upon ;
for though quiet and calm, he was thoroughly com-

bative, and enjoyed seeing his friend’s blood up, λ

¹1 believe this was the true though secret source of
much of my father's knowledge of the minute personal
history of every one in his region, which,-to his people,
knowing his reserved manner and his devotion to his stu-
dies, and his so rarely meeting them or speaking to them,

except from the pulpit‚ or at a diet of visitation, was a ¹
perpetual wonder, and of which he made great use in his r

dealings with his afflicted or erring “ members.”
