Notes on Art. 431

anything, but into the immense future, take posses·
sion of your mind. He is turning the north side of
the Alps3 he is about descending into Italy 3 and
what of that l-we all know now what of that, 3ηά
do not know yet all of it. We were then, such of Ι

us as may have been born, as unconscious of what
was before us and him, as that patient mule or his
simple master. Look at the face narrowly: it is
thin ; the cheeks sunken, the chin exquisite, with
its sweet dimple 3 the mouth gentle, and firm, and
sensitive, but stillas death, not thinking of words
or speech, but merely letting the difficult air of that
Alpine region in and out. That same mouth which
was to ignore the word impossible and call it a beast,
and to know it, and be beaten by it in the end ; that
thin, delicate, straight nose leading you to the eyes,
with their pencilled and well-pronounced brows3
there is the shadow of youth, and of indifferent
health, under and around these eyes, giving to their
power and meaning a singular charm-they are the
wonder of the picture. He is looking seriously, but
blankly, far on and up, seeing nothing outwardly,
the mind’s eye seeing-who can tell what? His
cheek is pale with the longing of greatness. The
young and mighty spirit within is awakening, and
hardly knows itself and its visions, but it looks out
clearly and firmly, though with a sort of vague sad·
ness, into its appointed field.
