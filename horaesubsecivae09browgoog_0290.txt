l used to think Sir 'Philip Sydney, or Ariosto's ἶ
knights and the Paladins of old, must have looked l
and moved as he did. He had great pleasure in
the company of high-bred, rehned, thoughtful l
women; and he had a peculiar sympathy with ]
the sufferings, the necessary mournfulness of wo j

men, and with all in their lot connected with the r

fruit of that forbidden trec-their loneliness‚ the
sorrows of their time, and their pangs in travail,

their peculiar relation to their children. I think ἵ
Ι hear him reading the words, “Can a woman y
forget her sucking child, that she should not hav'e j

compassion on the son of her womb? Yea'’
(as if it was the next thing to impossible), “she
may forget, yet will not Ι forget thee.'' Indeed,
to a man who saw so little of, and said so little
to his own children, perhaps it may be because of

all this, his sympathy for mothers under loss of Ι

children, his real suffering for their suffering, not ¹

only endeared him to them as their minister, their
consoler, and gave him opportunities of dropping

· in divine and saving truth and comfort, when the ’

heart was full and soft, tender, and at his mercy, ¹

but it brought out in his only loss of this kind, the
mingled depth, tenderness, and also the peremptori-
ness of his nature.
