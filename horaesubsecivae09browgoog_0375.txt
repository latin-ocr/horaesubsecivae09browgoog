Here are at random some extracts from χι the

others :— ,

“ Mr. Jeffrey now inquired what the people in
her part of the country thought of the trial of the
Qeen. She could not tell him, but she would
say what she herself had remarked on 'siclike pro-
ceedings: ‘Tak' a wreath of snaw, let it be never
so white, and wash it through clean water, it will
no come out so pure as it gaed in, far less the dirty
dubs the poor Queen has been drawn through? ''

Mr. Russell inquired if she possessed any relies
of Prince Charles from t'he time he used to spin
with the lasses :-

“ Y'esss’ she said, “1 have astech that loupit aff
him upon my aunty, the Lady Brax, when she was
helping him on wi' his short-gown; my aunty
rowed it up in a sheet of white paper, and she
keepit it in the tea canister, and she ca'd it aye the
King's Flech3 and the laird, honest man, when he
wanted a cup of gude tea, sought aye a cup of the
Prince’s mixture.'’ This produced pealsof laughter,
and her ladyship laughed as heartily as any of them.
When somewhat composed again, she looked across
the table to Mr. Clerk, and offered to let him see
it. “Itis now set on the pivot of my watch,
and a‘ the warks gae round the flccb in place of
turning round on a diamond.’'
