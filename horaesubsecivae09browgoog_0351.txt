Letter to John Cairns, D.D. 329

not remember, till near the close of his life, his
ever being in bed a day.

From his nervous system, and his hrain predomi-
nating steadily over the rest of his body, he was
habitually excessive in his professional work. As
to quantity, as to quality, as to manner and expres·
sion, he flung away his life without stint every
Sabbath-day, his sermons being laboriously pre-
pared, loudly mandated, and at great expense of
body and mind, and then delivered with the utmost
vehemence and rapidity. He was quite uncon-
scious of the state he worked himself into, and of
the loud piercing voice in which he often spoke.
This Ι frequently warned him about, as being, I
knew, injurious to himself, and often painful to his
hearers, and his answer always was, that he was
utterly unaware of it; and thus it continued to the
close, and very sad it was to me who knew the
peril, and saw the coming end, to listen to his
noble, rich, persuasive, imperative appeals, and to
know that the surplus of power, if retained, would, ι
by God’s blessing, retain him, while the effect on
his people would, I am sure, not have lost, but in
some respects have gained, for much of the *dis-
course which was shouted and sometimes screamed
at the full pitch of his keen voice, was of a kind to
l be better rendered in his deep, quiet, settled tones.
