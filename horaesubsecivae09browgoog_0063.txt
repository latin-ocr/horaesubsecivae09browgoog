Vauglzan’r Formi, &a 41

no intemperance of thought or phrase. Why
does not “ V.'' write more?

We do not very well know how to introduce
our friend Mr. Ellison, “The Bornnatural,'' who
addresses his “Madmoments to the Lightheaded
of Society at large.'’ We fe'el as a father, a
mother, or other near of kin would at introducing
, an ungainly gifted and much loved son or kinsman,
who had the knack of putting his worst foot fore·
most, and making himself imprimis ridiculous.

There is something wrong in all awkwardness‚
a want of nature somewlrem and we feel affronted
even still, after we have taken the Bornnatural1 to
our hem, and admire and love him, at his absurd
gratuitous sels-befoolment. The book is at first
sight one farrago of oddities and offences-coarse
foreign paper-bad printing—-italics broadcast over
every page-the words run into each other in a
way we are glad to say is as yet quite original,
making such extraordinary monsters of words as

’ these—beingsriddle—sunbeammotes—gooddeed—

midjune-summerair—selffavour—seraphechoes—

1In his Preface he explains the title Bornnatural, as
meaning “one who inherits the natural sentiments and
tastes to which he was born, still artunsullied and cus-
tomfree.''
