Vaugh'an’s Poems, &a ας

Or shall these early, fragrant hours

Ι Unlock thy bowres i
And ¹with their blush of light descry
Thy locks crown'd with eternitie?
Indeed, it is the only time
That with thy glory doth best chime3
All now are stirring, ev’ry field

F ull hymns doth yield;

The whole Creation shahes off night,
And for thy shadow looks the light.’'

This last line is full of grandeur and originality.

‘⁴ Lord, when thou didst on Sinai pitch‚
And shine froin Paran, when a firie Law‚
Pronounc'd with thunder and thy threats, did thaw
Thy People's heare, when all thy weeds were rich,
And Inaccessible fot light,
Terronr, and might 3-
How did poore flesh‚ which after thou didst westre,
Then ¹faint and sear!

Thy Chosen flock, like leafs in a high wind,

Whisper'd obediente, and their heads inelin’d.'’

The idea in the last lines, we may suppose, was
suggested by what Isaiah says of the effect pro-
duced on Ahaz and the ,men of Judah, when they

heard that Rezin, king of Syria, had joinedlsrael
against them: “And his heatt was moved, and
the heatt of his people, as the treet os the wood are

mwed by the winds.''
