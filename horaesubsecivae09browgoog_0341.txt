Letter to John cairus, D.D. 319

him, its silver stream rising into sudden flood, and
rolling irresistibly on its way.1

We question if as many carefully thought and
worded, and rapidly and by no means laboriously
written sermons, were composed anywhere else in
Britain during his fifty years-every Sunday two
new ones3 the composition faultless-such as
Cicero or Addison would have made them, had
they been U. P. ministers; only there was always
in them more soul than body, more of the spirit
than of the letter. Whata contrast to the much
turbid, hot, hasty, perilous stuff os our day and
preachers! ¹The original power and size of Dr. -

¹ Such an occasional paroxysm of eloquente is thus de·
scribed by Dr. Cairns :-“ At certain irregular intervals,
when the lostier themes of the gospel rninistry were to be
handled, his manner underwent a transformation which
was startling‚ and even electrical. He became rapt and
excited as with new inspiration; his utterance grew thick
and rapid; his voice trembled and faltered with emotion}
his eye gleamed with a wild unearthly lustre, in which
his countenance shared; and his whole lrame heaved to
and fro, as if each glowing thought and vivid figure that
followed in quick succession were only a fragment of
some greater revelation which he panted to overtale.
The writer of this notice has witnessed nothing similar in
any preacher‚ and numbers the effects of a passage which
he once heard upon the scenes and exercises of the hea-
venly world among his most thrilling recollections ol
sacred oratory.''—Mcrnoir prefixed to posthumam volume of
Disrourres.
