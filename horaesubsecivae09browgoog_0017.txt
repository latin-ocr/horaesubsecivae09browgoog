.' appended my letter to him, which forms

Preface. ix
l have, by the kindness of Dr. Caims,

a supplementary chapter to his admirable
Memoirof my father. l somehow wished it,
lame and imperfect and wandering as it is,
to be in these Hours. lt is little else than
an expansion, and often, l sear, a dilution
of the noble passage, by the same friend
and brother, which closes the Preface to the
First Series. May my father's Master, and

his, deal kindly with him, as he has dealt
with the dead.

F rrrrrrrrrrrr
